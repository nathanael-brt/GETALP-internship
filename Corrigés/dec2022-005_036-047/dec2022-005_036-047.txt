036		036 Role A
036		Good morning
036		so
036		We were asked to make suggestion to the supervisor
036		about the foundation priorities
036		I'm actually really in favor to develop technologies
036		really ? Well for me is like it's a tools
036		It's used in everyday life as a professional
036		or professionals use technologies every day
036		So we need to teach the students how to use it
036		in order for them to succeed in their professional life
036		Yeah
036		Yeah, Yeah, I agree with you
036		That's why the school need to provide them
036		with computer and technology material
036		It's the school to provide them
036		such as the school provides the books
036		For example
036		Well, I disagree because it's an investments
036		Like book needs to be changed every two or three years
036		and you have to buy like a way... like a wide range of books
036		for every materials and for all the students
036		whereas when you have the computer
036		you only buy one computer and you have all the material on one computer
036		and it's used not for one students but for a lot of them
036		Well, it's more expensive but when students
036		degrades books they need to repay for it
036		so if they degrades the computer they will need to repay it
036		Well, maybe if the computer stays that school is safer for the material
036		like if they don't bring it at home
036		they only use it inside the school
036		maybe their are less risk to break it
036		Yeah, so for me, like, using technology is really important
036		and to develop like creativity and self learning
036		because it's more an intuitive way to learn
036		than just writing books and memorize information
036		and so it's more like the learning to make projects to do research
036		and stuff like that so we give them more trust
036		and there are more ability for them to learn
036		I disagree with you about that
036		it might be true about writing
036		whereas typing on the computer
036		but actually when you search the information yourself
036		you'll like more interested in the task
036		so you will retain the information better
036		Yeah but, school is not only about learning information
036		in order to put it in the exam
036		it's also about learning how to search, how to make a projects
036		how to create something and how to research the information
036		in order to learn more or to develop some competence
036		So for that I think the technology is the right tools and not books
036		Yeah, of course we need to put finances into our budget
036		to finance all this project
036		And of course education comes first before technologies
036		So in Africa, education even if it starts with book
036		and then can involve with technology is more important
036		but if we want them to really succeed
036		they need to learn how to use all the tools
036		they're going to use in their professional life
036		That's why for me we need to increase our technology teaching
036		but for that the teachers need to be formed as well
036		they cannot just put the child in front of the computer
036		and let them do their thing, they need to guide them
036		and that way we are not in the system where the teacher is on a shelf
036		and like the students are behind him
036		but it's more cooperative when the teacher only guide them
036		and the students all self learning or self-creating
036		yeah, not what I said
036		actually we just need to increase the work and the teaching we do with technologies
036		and the age of the teacher doesn't matter
036		actually teachers needs to be formed
036		because well science is always evolving for example
036		we're not saying that the earth is flat nowadays
036		so teachers always have to learn in order to teach
036		and if the teachers learn about technology the age of the teacher really doesn't matter
036		so for me it's really important and education is always about teaching and learning
036		whereas your a students or a teacher
036		yeah maybe just increase like technology class
036		it's an investment, so the future it will go back
036		okay we can go with the transition
047		047 Role B
047		Hello, colleague
047		I'm not 
047		Yeah, I agree with you but
047		You know some students are poor
047		And some professional are rich because they have a job
047		and they have a life, they have a family
047		And sometimes students
047		even where they are immigrants
047		for example
047		they don't have any money to buy a computer
047		and it's difficult for those people to use computer at school
047		Yes, but books are less expensive than computers
047		School can't buy all computers for all students
047		And if there is some degradation on the computer what you do
047		if some students break it or don't take care of computer
047		what you do? You change it and it's more expensive
047		that change your book
047		Yes, but repay a computer is too expensive for students
047		look at some manifestation in the street
047		where students are poor
047		ask for money, ask for money for buy food
047		for buy an habitation and it's not possible for student to buy a computer
047		as they want
047		So you want to make a mix like at school computer
047		and at home books
047		Yes, but some studies show that we learn better with a book
047		while we're reading that while we're typing or we're searching on the internet
047		So it's more difficult for students to learn by a computer
047		than if they read a book
047		Yes, but you can also search the information in the book
047		and you can write it in... by your hand
047		and it will be better for your memory
047		by my personal experience
047		I know that to learn something I had to read it, I had to learn it
047		and if I only type it on the computer I can't go to exam and succeed
047		I agree but look, in... for example in... we are not in Africa but in Africa
047		they can't have a book already
047		and if we want to reorganize the school system
047		that mean that some people that can't buy a book
047		have to buy a computer, it's impossible
047		And you think...
047		Yes, but you have to buy computers
047		you have to teach teacher how to use computer
047		you have to say at some teacher that are old
047		that are learning some... all of those teacher are not able to use computer
047		because they learn school with books
047		they are learn school with writing at the hand
047		so that's mean that we need to change everything
047		and I think it's a little bit complicated in one second
047		so we... I agree with you with all what you said
047		but we have to make a transition
047		not to stop all of book and to pass all of computers
047		I agree with you so we can make some agreement
047		a little bit not too more
047		because it's dangerous for for economic of family
047		for economic of school it's a
047		i agree with you 
047		a transition not too fast
047		okay perfect
