005		05
005		005
005		and I'm role A
005		Okay, I understand your point of view
005		but today the technology is quite important
005		because we need
005		computer to access to websites
005		or 
005		things like this and teacher has
005		need sorry, to show things to 
005		the class or things like this
005		I agree but I think that
005		the foudation 
005		priorities should be the
005		development of new way
005		with new 
005		technologies to learn and
005		to teach
005		for the 
005		kids it's an...
005		it's a better way to...
005		to learn
005		because they are more
005		happy
005		to be there
005		they enjoy
005		the class and for the
005		teachers it's
005		more simple because
005		they can
005		use a lot
005		of things and
005		diversify the...
005		how the...
005		how they work
005		I know, I agree with you but
005		technology is also
005		keyboard
005		or
005		the...
005		the things that can
005		project an image on the
005		keyboard
005		and it's not just the computer
005		so if we invest
005		in the
005		research of new technology
005		we may
005		discovery the new way
005		who
005		do not need to be on the
005		computer or Ipad
005		or something like this but
005		who can be technology and 
005		help the teacher
005		I know that and actually it
005		doesn't really
005		concern us it's
005		the government
005		who has to help
005		this school and this teacher
005		and also the parents because maybe
005		the child is
005		in a
005		great
005		school but he
005		may has no money
005		but it's the government who has
005		to help the...
005		the school
005		and we
005		should
005		offer them the
005		opportunity to...
005		to buy new stuff
005		okay
005		but maybe we should just talk
005		about this with... talk
005		about this with the
005		governments
005		for communication and
005		try to
005		see what we can do but I think
005		that even if we
005		don't know
005		what the government was going to
005		 say, we know 
005		that we have to
005		invest on your technology because 
005		it's
005		too
005		important.
005		the government will...
005		will choose to
005		invest, it's 
005		an evidence becauset here is too many...
005		too many...
005		hum
005		too many
005		how to say it
005		that he
005		knows he has to do it because the
005		school need this for work, and work in a good way, because we saw that the child and the teacher are more...
005		are more... are happiest in the school when there is more technology.
005		Yes, I agree with you, because we all know that screen is bad for everyone, not just children.
005		And we, it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you said.
005		So we .. the teacher do this part, they have to adapt with the things that we offer to them.
005		And so we just had to agree with the fact that we invest, and that's it.
005		Okay.
025		and I'm a candidate 025
025		and I'm a role B
025		So I personally think that new technologies
025		aren't any good in class
025		and it should be
025		it should be something that is out of the school
025		and not in the school
025		Yes, 
025		of course, I hear this
025		but I think that
025		there are some studies
025		that show that
025		there are 
025		two kind of
025		of situation
025		I think there is a
025		when there...
025		when there are
025		everyday new technologies
025		and it can
025		represent a distraction
025		and of course
025		on the other side
025		there can be like once a week
025		a class with computers
025		to learn new
025		technologies to the
025		students
025		Yes, but
025		we know for quite
025		a time now that
025		the ammount of time that teen
025		so students pass on
025		device and like smartphone,
025		computer
025		is a great
025		huge amount of time
025		like 6 to 8 hours
025		a day
025		so we do not need 
025		to increase this...
025		this time
025		This is a good point
025		money
025		if you want a new technology
025		in class this should be with great
025		equipment like you said
025		not necessarily
025		a computer per student
025		but
025		there will be some 
025		investment that we need
025		to do and of course
025		there will be
025		maybe
025		instruction of the teacher because not
025		all teacher
025		knows how to use keyboard
025		or computer
025		for their
025		course for
025		mathematic for example and
025		so there is
025		maybe inequality
025		between school that has the money
025		for this and school that 
025		doesn't have
025		I agree with you
025		so if the government
025		say that you will
025		invest in this
025		and of course...
025		of course give 
025		money to school that
025		doesn't have that much money
025		I can
025		eventually think
025		that some technology
025		on a certain level
025		with a minimum
025		amount of time
025		can be good
025		because
025		of course
025		this is not
025		all bad
025		Yes, but we have to
025		invest on it, but to invest we have to...
025		we need to have money and to make sure
025		that some 
025		people like government
025		or
025		other kind of people will help
025		and will do everything they can
025		so there isn't any
025		inequality between school
025		and between students because
025		this is the future
025		sorry, this is the future
025		of the country so if
025		some kids doesn't
025		have the same education
025		than other this will be
025		this will
025		increase inequality
025		Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation, technology can be slowly,
025		integrate in a classroom, but with regulation like I said, not every day, like once a week, for example,
025		to start, or like one hour a day or something like this.
025		Yes, so I agree with you.
