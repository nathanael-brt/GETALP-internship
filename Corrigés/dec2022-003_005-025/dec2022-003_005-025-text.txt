005   05                              005 and I'm role A
Ens   Your candidate number?     your candidate number is 005


025   and I'm a candidate 025  and I'm a role B
Ens   Okay, you can begin


025   So I personally think that new technologies  aren't any good in class


025   and it should be  it should be something that is out of the school


005   Okay, I understand your point of view
025   and not in the school


005   but today the technology is quite important  because we need


005   computer to access to websites  or things like this and teacher has


005   need sorry, to show things to  the class or things like this
025   Yes,


025   of course, I hear this  but I think that there are some studies


025   that show that  there are two kind of of situation I think there is a


025   when there...  when there are everyday new technologies and it can


025   represent a distraction  and of course on the other side


025   there can be like once a week  a class with computers to learn new


005   I agree but I think that the foudation
025   technologies to the  students


005   priorities should be the  development of new way with new


005   technologies to learn and  to teach for the kids it's an...


005   it's a better way to...  to learn because they are more happy to be there


005   they enjoy  the class and for the teachers it's more simple because


005   they can  use a lot of things and diversify the... how the...


005   how they work
025   Yes, but we know for quite a time now that


025   the ammount of time that teen  so students pass on


025   device and like smartphone,  computer is a great huge amount of time


025   like 6 to 8 hours  a day so we do not need to increase this... this time


005   I know, I agree with you but  technology is also keyboard or the...


005   the things that can  project an image on the keyboard


005   and it's not just the computer  so if we invest in the


005   research of new technology  we may discovery the new way who


005   do not need to be on the  computer or Ipad or something like this but


005   who can be technology and  help the teacher
025   This is a good point money


025   if you want a new technology  in class this should be with great


025   equipment like you said  not necessarily a computer per student but


025   there will be some  investment that we need to do and of course


025   there will be  maybe instruction of the teacher because not all teacher


025   knows how to use keyboard  or computer for their course for


025   mathematic for example and  so there is maybe inequality


025   between school that has the money  for this and school that doesn't have


005   I know that and actually it  doesn't really concern us it's the government


005   who has to help  this school and this teacher


005   and also the parents because maybe  the child is in a great school but he


005   may has no money  but it's the government who has to help the...


005   the school  and we should offer them the opportunity to...


005   to buy new stuff
025   I agree with you so if the government say that you will


025   invest in this  and of course... of course give money to school that


025   doesn't have that much money  I can eventually think that some technology


025   on a certain level  with a minimum amount of time can be good because


005   okay but maybe we should just talk
025   of course  this is not all bad


005   about this with... talk  about this with the governments


005   for communication and  try to see what we can do but I think


005   that even if we  don't know what the government was going to say, we know


005   that we have to  invest on your technology because it's too important.


025   Yes, but we have to  invest on it, but to invest we have to...


025   we need to have money and to make sure  that some people like government


025   or  other kind of people will help and will do everything they can


025   so there isn't any  inequality between school and between students because


025   this is the future  sorry, this is the future of the country so if


025   some kids doesn't  have the same education than other this will be


005   the government will... will choose to
025   this will  increase inequality


005   invest, it's  an evidence becauset here is too many... too many... hum


005   too many  how to say it that he knows he has to do it because the


005   school need this for work, and work in a good way, because we saw that 
      the child and the teacher are more...


005   are more... are happiest in the school when there is more technology.


025   Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation, technology can be 
      slowly,


025   integrate in a classroom, but with regulation like I said, not every day, 
      like once a week, for example,


025   to start, or like one hour a day or something like this.


005   Yes, I agree with you, because we all know that screen is bad for 
      everyone, not just children.


005   And we, it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you said.


005   So we .. the teacher do this part, they have to adapt with the things 
      that we offer to them.


005   And so we just had to agree with the fact that we invest, and that's it.


005   Okay.
025   Yes, so I agree with you.
