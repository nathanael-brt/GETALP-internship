017		Yes, zero, one, seven.
017		role A
017		Okay.
017		You start.
017		as you want, yes
017		I personally think that have technology in classes, it's a new perspective of teaching,
017		and it enables students to be curious and search information online on topics they like.
017		And also, ecologically speaking, it's good for environment, because we don't have to use paper.
017		So I think it's quite good.
017		I'm listening to your point but.
017		I think it have this topic of technology in classes has pros and cons,
017		and you're telling and cons that is harassment.
017		But I think that things could be put to avoid harassment.
017		I don't have solutions.
017		I have mixed feelings about that, because I think that technology can allow children or students and teachers
017		to have a dialogue, another dialogue from the classic school.
017		And I think also that now with the development of data, it's more practical.
017		To search online things than in books.
017		And how about the
017		Oh, I don't know.
017		I don't know, but it's allow to do a certain
017		How do you say?
017		You can follow the line and
017		I think it's great to have technology in school and at home because for children,
017		it's more practical 
017		and for sorry, and for
017		teachers, it's a new perspective to teach and it's interesting for them.
017		Yes.
017		The fact is that teachers in their childhood, in the last decades, weren't abilitate to use technology because it didn't exist.
017		But the thing is that they can now be coached and they can intern
017		Learn to children who don't know how to proceed.
017		So we can found a
017		a compromise, yes.
017		Yes.
017		I'm totally agree with you.
017		And I think one or two hours per day or per weeks, it's a good thing.
017		Yes.
017		Yes.
017		Yeah.
017		Both are perfect.
029		Zero, two, nine, and role B.
029		Okay.
029		Okay.
029		I'm gonna defend the fact that the school should moderate the use of the technology
029		in the classroom, because there's a lot of negative point about it.
029		Like, it's not a good thing to be in-screen all day for a child, because it 's can develop
029		 anxiety and the child can become anger more usually.
029		And they're not very concentrate when they're on a screen.
029		No one can really watch what they're doing in front of the screen, so it can develop
029		cyber harassment, so it's why it should be moderate.
029		Well, what about the moderation of the use, because of the cyber harassment that can be made of?
029		But don't you think that people must not be very concentrate when they're not in front of the screen?
029		You know what I mean? When the teacher is speaking in a traditional way,
029		that you will think, okay, let's not be concentrate now and be concentrate on the screen because it's fun and it's
029		What about the anxiety, the anger, and all the negative points that the studies show of the screen?
029		Don't you think that allow children who, at home, is usually on the screen, come to class?
029		Also, a screen is a good thing for the development of the child or not.
029		practical yeah
029		But what about the people who are not very
029		who are Who don't really use the teacher,  the old teacher, who don't really use the screen or everything.
029		And when you ask them to teach with the things that they didn't know how to use it's
029		Learn to
029		a compromise
029		I listen what you are saying and I think that the screen is a good thing but it should be moderate.
029		I'm not It's not a no for me to be used at school but it should be moderate because of everything that is the consequence of the using of the screen.
029		Yeah.
029		And not no more.
029		It should be a
029		The traditional way should be used.
029		And not only on the screen.
