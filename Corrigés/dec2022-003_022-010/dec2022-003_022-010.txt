022		Yes, my number is 022
022		In my opinion, technology in class is very harm and it's not good.
022		We use pen and papers for long decades, blackboard, books.
022		I'm not interested in technology.
022		It's successful
022		Yeah I see, but you see all the exams are passed in paper with pen.
022		We don't have tablets or computer in the exams.
022		I see, but for the students you talk before you know some studies spoke about
022		it raise anxiety and reduce self-esteem.
022		We could have issues of addictivity of students.
022		Many students use computer or technology six to eight hours a day.
022		It's enough and we don't have to use it in classroom.
022		to avoid screen
022		I see your purpose, but the final point I want to talk about it's  technology is very expensive.
022		Lot of schools are do not have many income and technology is very expensive.
022		How do you do with that?
022		Ok, I saw your purpose and why it's interesting.
022		I'm ready to act to use interactive whiteboards in classroom.
022		It is very it's interesting whiteboard or not?
022		Okay, so yeah, it's okay.
022		We can saw the supervisor to buy some interactive whiteboard.
010		and me it's 010.
010		In my opinion, I think technology it's a good idea and it's also an actual subject.
010		So it can be it can help teacher to organize her lesson.
010		And also for students, it can be make the lesson more interesting and more interactive.
010		So I think it's a good idea.
010		Yes, but maybe we can do a part of technology and also a part of paper and pen.
010		So maybe the school can do during the year some exam for training the students to continuing to write.
010		Maybe the school can organize a sensibilization of students to show that
010		to show the limits of technology, maybe like they can show that the students can also learn
010		read books and doesn't usually use technology and also shows the limit of time screen.
010		For example, the night when the students go to sleep if they have to
010		doesn't use technology 
010		Yes, yes, thank you.
010		I think the students that can pay for her for their computer can buy her their own computer.
010		And I think the schools have to prepare her budget before and I don't have a real solution for the money.
010		I think maybe for the school who can not invested on computer, have to keep the traditional paper and pen.
010		Yes, yes, I think it's a good idea.
010		Because it can the students can participate with this?
Ens		022.
Ens		010.
Ens		OK.
