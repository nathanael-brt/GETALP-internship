120		120, moi je suis le 120 situation 1 role A
120		yeah
120		Yes.
120		I think I have a clear, clear, clear, clear position about the animal testing.
120		I just think this is an archaic method, completely outdated, and we have to just think about
120		how we can did... doing... do these experiences without animal testing.
120		Because that's just wasting money for nothing, because any solution could replaced these animal
120		testing experiences.
120		Okay.
120		Okay, may I correct you just in one point.
120		Maybe in the past, it was a very great solution.
120		It was completely great to understand, as you say, the functionment of our body, understand the...
120		our physical construction, etc... but today, we have to think ethically and rehumanize... rehumanize our science.
120		Explain it to me
120		But, we are continuating to kill any day
120		Okay.
120		Okay, you're "rassuring" me
120		great point
120		 No It's false.
120		It's the same thing
120		the same thing, tell me about Alzheimer's it's a subject that I know
120		we are... are you okay with me we are...
120		Yes.
120		that is... that is... what you... that is...
120		And what do you think... What do you think about to create a processus of experimentation in vitro, by example,
120		for, in the same time, and in the second time, we can effectively create a program in computer
120		modellization, which are very, very, very performant, more, maybe, more, in the, in the
120		lot of time, more performant that animal testing, where, computering... computer modellization
120		are more efficient in a lot of time that... so we could, we could
120		say that, okay, it was the past, we did animal testing, and we know the functionment of
120		our body, and the body, and the... and cellular, that, that create disease, et cetera, okay.
120		But now, it's time to, transit to a way of science which are more human, and when... we
120		didn't talk about money
120		money
120		Yes, yes, but a lot of, there, there is more
120		subvention, as you say, to have, when we are, when we are in the program, in the RS program,
120		in the RS program, RS program, you know, with the xxx the three R. So,
120		if we are, coming in RS program, three R, we have more subventions, and that could be
120		a transition step, between, between the, the experience with animals, and without animal. But,
120		I just want to, to say, one, one, one, one thing, one fact, 26 billions of dollar, that have been
120		invest in, experience animal testing, and just 95 percent did not succeed, who didn't translate
120		the medicant for human, that we test on animals. This is really close and this is... and... We could put all this money
120		on computing... computer modelization, which increase... which will be... which will increase more and
120		more, the performance of, computing... computer modelization and...
120		we know the basis, yes we know the basis
120		Oh, sorry, I'm not in scientifical lessons, or grades or... So, so I don't know. But we... Yes.
120		I'm okay with the three R's. Maybe, maybe, maybe
120		an acceleration, an acceleration of the three R. because to... When the three R have been
120		created, 15th, in the 15th, 1950.
120		Are you okay to say that it's outdated ?
120		We have to create a new three R with acceleration and big engaged to...
120		In the future ? In the future we can ?
120		How many year ? How many year ?
120		25 year? 
120		No
120		we have to create the acceleration of three R that could be 
120		the three R, speedy, the speedy three R and to... to
120		No, no, no we could just 
120		create a compromise with your idea. No, no, no no no no.
120		you want to skip the animal testing in the... in 25 years. This is outdated.
120		Anthropologically, anthropologically, create a barrier between us, human, we... that we are just
120		exploiting the rest of nature. It's just outdated. It was in the 19th, in the 20th century. Okay,
120		it was great, and we understand the functionment of the basis of gene, etc. But this is not...
120		today.
120		Okay so ?
120		With this consideration and xxx anthropological
120		i listen to you
120		Yes we've... Okay
120		Could we... Could we just
120		notify that we could accelerate the three R method 
120		at the conclusion
120		at the most important
120		last, the last sentence.
120		Oh, you are... you are.. you are hard, you are hard. But we are okay to say 
120		that 25 years to skip the animal testing is too... Okay.
034		034 situation 1 role B
034		Okay, so we should write some article about animal testing.
034		What do you think about it? What... The angle we should...
034		Okay, so we have a problem because I disagree.
034		I think we should write this article in favor of animal testing, because this method
034		allow breakthrough in science and research for scientific and to understanding the human
034		body and human disease and everything.
034		So for me, animal testing is the right method to allow the humanity to have a better life
034		with understanding this function... this functionment
034		But we can do that, rehumanize our science, and using animals like in a better way
034		that before. Like we can...
034		We don't, we don't 
034		We don't have the obligation to kill like for example we can use animals
034		and testing animal for some subject, but not for other, like, for example, cosmetic and testing
034		animals
034		It's an... a shame
034		it's a nonsense.
034		No, because we have alternatives, but like, for example, human disease, sometimes we
034		don't have the correct alternative, like, for example.
034		Alzheimer's, 
034		No, Alzheimer's, the case of Alzheimer's in the mice, we have, we can cure mice who
034		have Alzheimer's, but we cannot translate it for now, at the human, because we didn't understand
034		the molecular basis, but to take alternative, we can use, for example, computer alternative.
034		But to use it, we have to understands the molecular basis.
034		So if we don't have the molecular basis, we cannot use alternative, before you have
034		to find the alternative by animal testing, respectfully
034		it's not exactly the same conclusions
034		but it's not a question about efficient
034		what money ?
034		We have the subventions, because we are, legally... we have, legally, the obligation to do animal
034		testing, it's right in a lot of xxx treatment.
034		yes but like I said...
034		Yes but like I said it's not about efficient, and increase the development, it's about reality and... reality and point of the world.
034		It's like, if you don't understand the basis, you cannot create... So, no, we don't know 
034		the basis. Ok So, how... what is the basis of Alzheimer? Molecular basis.
034		So we don't have the basis, so whe have to find it, maybe, maybe you're right, and maybe we can take the point of view of the
034		middle, like the three R's.
034		but the three R's use... use animal. No, no, no, we cannot...
034		we cannot accelerate it
034		 Yes, but it's a plan of long time. But... No..
034		You have to... we have to find alternative but we cannot skip the animal testing like...
034		No, in the future, we can, but now we cannot. 
034		25 years? 
034		yeah
034		Like the time to
034		okay so, alternative : we write our article about the three R and you do your
034		research about the speedy three R's after the article, deal? 
034		I create a compromise you refuse it.
034		No, no no no no, I want to write our articles
034		You can... You can... You can write... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, we have
034		to write an article and choose an angle. So, you can write, it's outdated.
034		I can write. No, no, no, listen to me. You write, it's outdated. I write, we still do it, 
034		and we write the three R's method. 
034		read ? deal ?
034		Okay
034		at the conclusion
034		at the conclusion maybe the last
034		in little
034		
Ens		When you're ready
