129		Number 129, role A
129		So hello, today we are gonna discuss about
129		the... we are gonna suggest to our supervisor if we have to put technologies on
129		the classroom of... if we don't have to implement this in the classroom. So first, I think that
129		this is a good thing to implement this type of technology like computers in this class... in the classroom
129		in the course and the school in general because I think the first students like it and there
129		is already studies that have showed that there is a higher level of engagement. For example,
129		for students who don't like to talk because they are a little scared, etc...
129		I get your point here, but I think that even if there is no computer on the classroom,
129		there is already a possible student who can play on the phone or something else.
129		that already can distract other student behind them, but I get your point here and I agree with you.
129		Okay, I understand, but I think that this is not the at risk student who buy these computer.
129		I think that school where they are in must buy this computer for them.
129		Like this is already happening in some area where the state gives free computers to student and student don't have to pay them.
129		Maybe you want to say that this is a little lost of time and I think that this is a lot of... a lost of time in the present.
129		But after, I think that thanks to these technology and computers, students will learn lessons and skills more fast, faster.
129		So I think that the time will be gained after.
129		Okay, I go along with you.
129		I think that all student and people today are a bit addicted to this type of technology like computers or phone.
129		But I think that this is the student or the people at home who have to reduce the time they are using this technology because it is very useful in the school I think.
129		Okay, okay. Yes, I think that we have to just not use them, use the computers and this technology every day at school.
129		But I think this is a good idea to add computers in classroom and more.
129		It can help for future jobs because now all jobs will be like engineer for artificial intelligence.
129		And so we have to have a student who learn this type of skills to have a good jobs in the future.
129		Yes, I agree.
129		We don't have to put children at like five or four years old, directly in this type of technology.
129		We have to before know the life.
129		But yes, we have to regulate them like maybe twice a week or maybe just a few class or course, so yes.
129		Okay, so I think that we are finish and I agree with you with the twice a week and I think this is a good idea.
077		Number 77, role B
077		Hello, I share your view. But for me, I think that new technologies have problems.
077		These technologies can distract the students when they are in class. For example, if a student
077		play on his computer, the other student next to him can be distracted by him.
077		Yeah, it's true, but another problem of new technology is the cost of this technologies.
077		It's very expensive to buy a computer and at risk student can't buy a computer expensive
077		and they can have problem to access to network connection when they are at home.
077		And it can create a...
077		It creates a disadvantage for these students.
077		It's a good idea, but for me, moreover, a buy of a computer for at risk student,
077		the teacher need to have a formation to know how to integrate this technology in class without disturb the student.
077		Yeah, I go along with you there, but for me it's a good thing because a student can learn faster.
077		But the major problem is that the students have a sixth or eighth screen... look screen by day.
077		But if they use screen at school, it can increase this time spend on looking screen.
077		And it can provoct anxietity for the student.
077		Yeah, it's true.
077		And for me, we need to integrate this technology at school, but we need to limit the time spent on the screen.
077		and It can... gonna be a tool integrate at traditional method to learn.
077		It's in addition to this traditional method.
077		Obviously, it's a good thing for a job in the future but if... if we want to use this technology at school, we need to regulate them and begin to use this technology.
077		not before a certain age, like six years or ten years?
077		Yes, twice a week is a good idea because it keep the advantage of this technologies to learn faster and it reduce the anxiety of the screen.
