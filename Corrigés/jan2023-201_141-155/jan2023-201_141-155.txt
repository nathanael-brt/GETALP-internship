141		141 role B
141		Okay. So let's discuss about the article.
141		I suggest to write the article more about the animal testing and all the progress we can see thanks to that.
141		Yeah. Yeah. I understand what you said. I'm sure there was a lot of other things
141		we can talk about, but I think the main subject of the animal testing
141		is all the benefits we have thanks to. We can see all the medicine progress
141		and all the new treatment, medication.
141		And I think there is a lot of things to say about it and it could be a good angle.
141		Oh, yeah. Right. But it can be an example, but there is so much other medication
141		or treatment who worked. And the aspirine ones, okay, they try animal testing 
141		and it maybe doesn't work with this one and it was more relevant
141		with other method that, like, I don't know, computer method.
141		But this is, for the moment, the main, the most relevant practice to find 
141		to progress in any medicine study.
141		Yes. But as we can see, this is the one we use the most.
141		We don't really have a lot of, like, how to say...
141		We didn't work enough with other method to be sure it's a good one.
141		And this one, I think in my point of view,
141		I think this one could be great for our article
141		and we maybe have much things to say.
141		Yes, it would be great to talk about it for sure, for sure
141		We need to give all the information to everybody and to give a better understood... understanding of the subject.
141		But this is not the biggest argument, you know, what I mean.
141		They need those information in the article
141		but the main subject I keep my idea, it's the animal testing
141		and they could argument about it.
141		Because, yeah, we thought... we have a lot of other method, they work,
141		but we also have the, you know, the three R...
141		and I think it's a good argument to animal testing
141		iencebecause they took conscience of the painful or the harmful they could inflict to the animal
141		and they work with, but they still use the animal testing.
141		I think so, it's maybe a good compromise between.
141		So I...This is maybe something we can add on the article
141		like you have your idea and I have my point of view
141		and we can work both together, but I think we need to reclarify each point
141		and put like...  like, it's a shade of grey and not everything it's white or black.
141		Yeah but if we
141		Yeah, yeah, I think the two of them is great
141		because... if we
141		give only your point of view, everybody will be "Oh God
141		We have to stop animal testing because this is the bad things.
141		We just lost money.
141		It's not relevant and we don't conclude anything
141		because we don't have good result or just any result.
141		But that's not true because we have some result
141		and the research on animal testing.
141		It's for the moment the most... the one who's working well
141		because we can study like living cells
141		and the interaction between them.
141		and we can't xxx that on computer or anything so...
141		yeah I agree and, I think it's... this article can lead to a great information
141		and everybody can have their own opinion
141		with all the information I want to say.
141		Yeah, 
155		155 role A
155		Yeah. I don't really agree with your point of view because I don't think that we can write an article all about the progress
155		about the animal testing because, like, there are not just progress about it.
155		Yeah. But the thing that you're talking about are not very relevant
155		and not always relevant because we have seen a lot of problems in animal testing.
155		Like, the aspirine one, have you heard about it?
155		I read some researchers that were saying that in fact,
155		a lot of animal testing experiences were not finished
155		and they lead to nowhere, like, we don't have the results of them and it's
155		A large number of animal testing experience that have no
155		benefits on our society or on medical researches.
155		To my mind, this is not a right thing to do in our article
155		because xxx just that animal testing is the good
155		and, like, the only thing, but it's not true at all.
155		There are a lot of alternative methods.
155		I know that sometimes alternative method are not enough
155		but in many cases they are enough and we don't use them enough.
155		Yeah, the three R are like a rule, but not everybody follow the rules.
155		And I think we have to think twice about the fact that we are doing like animals belong to us
155		but animals don't belong to us.
155		They are just suffering in our laboratory and it's not like... we are pretending
155		this is a right thing or we are not even thinking about it.
155		It's not a subject that we talk about.
155		We are pretending that it's okay, but I don't think so.
155		Yeah, I can agree on something with you.
155		But I don't... I think that for many years, your point of view have been showed
155		so I think it's a right thing to show my point of view.
155		also like try the two of them.
155		I heard what you are saying.
155		But I think so we can show your point of view.
155		But we can also say that it's in many situation
155		we can do without animal testing.
155		And if we need animal testing,
155		maybe we can think to hire less animal,
155		less animals and in better conditions.
155		And like invest money fo their well-being.
155		Their well-being because...
155		If we are doing less animal testing,
155		we can do it in better condition maybe.
155		Yeah, I think that it's a good opportunity for the researchers
155		because we will write a very interesting article
155		with our both point of view.
155		And I'm glad that we are working together.
Ens		Thank you very much.
