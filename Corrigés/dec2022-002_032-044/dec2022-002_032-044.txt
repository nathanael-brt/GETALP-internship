032		Number 32, I have the role A.
032		You want to start, maybe?
032		Okay, I understand your point of view.
032		I think the problems can be solved with the experts that we can hire
032		to come help the teachers in class to avoid time loss.
032		And we have to make formations for teachers too to avoid the time loss with technical problems.
032		And I think we must do all of that because we have to use technology in xxx
032		because it can reduce inequalities between the students that are more affluent
032		and the ones who live in less affluent situations.
032		So we have to do all that.
032		Yes, indeed, the problem of money is very big problem.
032		To counter that, we have to make plans to replace the material and also make updates.
032		oftenly that can be considerate in the budget of the foundation.
032		So I think that's a problem but it can be... we can do with that.
032		Also, yes, you said that the students that have less money can't have the internet at home and that can be a issue with their homeworks.
032		And yes, as you said, we can provide them computers or 4G keys.
032		Because that's very important, that's
032		You talked about 20th century skills xxx before.
032		That's important that all the students can have those 20th century skills.
032		And all the... that's important that all of the students can have access to computers and the internet.
032		Yes, you're totally right.
032		For this problem, yes, as you said, we have to keep the pencil and paper based learning because as you said, state programs are traditional.
032		And the tests must be with pencil and paper.
032		So, plus we have to keep this way or learning because the time that spend young people on screens are already high.
032		So it must be not too high because it can cause anxiety and the social skills can be compromised.
032		So yes, we have indeed the role to limit this time on the screen.
032		I agree with you, but I think we can use technological learning.
032		Okay, so I'm glad that our students can profite of the technological learning in the future.
044		Number 44, role B.
044		Maybe, why not?
044		Yes, so our foundation wants to invest in technology for classroom.
044		I think it's an idea because we are in the 21st century.
044		But we have some problems with that.
044		And I want to show you why I'm maybe to moderate the technology using
044		because I think, firstly to the potential problem with connection.
044		And with this problem, we can have some losing time for teachers.
044		And I'm afraid that it could not the best solution for the student.
044		Yes, but I see two major problems, what.
044		 But I understand your... But I think we will have a problem of cost because it's very expensive
044		to have people to hire, to be here for this informatic problem.
044		And you say you want to learn to teacher maybe to solve this problem themselves
044		but it's also very expensive to learn to them.
044		And I think you spoke about inequality but some low incomes students will have technology in classroom.
044		It's a good idea.
044		I have no problem but you don't think that when they come back at home,
044		if they don't have a connection or good technology, maybe they will be in a situation of inequality because of that.
044		It's a question.
044		Or you can... we can invest for help them, with 4G key or other way, I don't know.
044		But it's very expensive.
044		And this problem of money xxx
044		Okay, so if you think to program and invest on the long time and we can maybe reduce the cost like that, I'm totally agree with this project.
044		But I have also another issue that I think is in adequation of this system for different points.
044		I think to the example for university and others that are writing, writing test and maybe as student who are dyslexic, maybe it could be more difficult for them with technology than writing.
044		But, so I suggest you to moderate and keep paper and pen and paper, methodology, even we can introduce technology, it's not a problem.
044		Just keep a part of old school.
044		So I think we can go to this big investment for this school, but it's clear for you and me and I very happy for that.
044		that we have to be careful to maintain old school methodology, but it's very important.
044		I'm agree to continue to invest for our century and for these students.
