023		023 role B
023		So we are here to defend our position on the foundation priority that could be in
023		matter of technology in the classroom. For me, I think that technology in school could
023		harm more than be good for students. For me schools should be moderate their
023		utilization of new technology.
023		Okay, I understand you point of view but for me I think that it can it could improve their
023		capacities but it also could distract them when they are in class and they just look
023		at the screen and I for me and for therapists also students and young people are already
023		too much in front of a screen. We can heard before that they are six or eight hours per day
023		in front of screen and if new technologies are allowed in school we couldn't
023		reduce this screen time.
023		Do you think that technologies can interest students more than if they are just with a pen and
023		Yeah, I couldn't agree more with you in this point and I think we can we could have a compromise
023		with this. For me I think that a little time of screen in school couldn't be couldn't have
023		bad effect on students because they have to live with their time but I think
023		school should moderate their use.
023		Okay, yeah, I agree with you on this.
023		And for you, what is the perfect time in a day for students?
023		Yeah, yeah, I agree with you with that.
023		And I also think that if there are more than one or two hours per day in front of a screen like
023		the therapist encourage this.
023		Students could have a addiction to technologies and their screen and their phone.
023		Yeah, I agree with you on this.
023		And to talk about another point, what do you think technology could do between students
023		who don't have a lot of money and don't have access to technologies.
023		And the students who already is who already had a phone, a computer and all this.
023		Yeah, yeah, I understand what you just said.
023		So to sum up, we agreed that one hour of technology and screen per day in a school, it's okay.
023		It's not too much to
023		Okay, I agree with you on this.
009		and me 009 role A
009		Okay, so in my opinion the technology in school is not harm but is like an experience
009		and a thing to improve the learn of these students and the express of these students.
009		Yes okay, I could considerate that can distract students but I think the students
009		enjoying the learn and they can be more, I don't know, but
009		Yes, it's like they are in her own house and it's more familiar for him to take
009		technologies and to simply learn.
009		Yes, they need to restrict the time of the students in the screen because I think
009		the students can be more able to deal with if they have a good situation
009		to use it simple.
009		for me, I think that's half an hour for day, it's a good time for students because
009		extend this time the students were not concentrated in the school.
009		Yes, meanwhile the school, some students have an addiction with the screen.
009		And the school didn't so
009		I And the school have a goal and this goal is to learn.
009		And I think that's the learning can be pass with the screen with technology.
009		But it's not the only goal of school.
009		It's not the school of technology, it's school of
009		So it's school to learn not to distract.
009		I think it's create disparities between a school who have technology in who have technology.
009		And these disparities need to be, not protected, but limitated, I think.
009		Because if we create disparities, we need to involve the fact that we can have people with or not technology.
009		And it's simply to school to create an environment for enjoy technology at school.
009		And not just for show us the disparity between this person or this person who have technology and who haven't.
009		Yes, It's a good condition for students, I think.
009		And to concludes, yes, technology it's create disparities.
009		But it's also creates good moments for students.
009		And they can just enjoying to stand up for in school.
009		And that's my point.
