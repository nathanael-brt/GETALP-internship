093		93
093		A
093		So  do you want to start?
093		Ok, So for me I think that technology is a good thing for the education because the kids or the children can
093		just learn something by make it a little bit more fun with games or something like this.
093		I think that the school can make the...
093		Yeah I see what you want to say, but I think that the parents need also to take a xxx and place some border to him at home.
093		And so we can make the school more funnier for the childrens.
093		I think that the education needs to be with games or on board that the children can interact with so...
093		The students can have access to internet or something like this to help him in this project, something like this.
093		Yes,  we can... the school can give to the students a computer or a tablet to do his homework at his home.
093		So this mean that every students, include low-income students, can have access to this digital tool.
093		The teacher can make formation. There is formation with a technology coach that can make the teacher more comfortable with the technology.
093		So now I want to ask you why there is a problem with the technology at the education... in the education ?
093		I think that's... for this problem we can have some money and just put the education technology in the years, like in 10 years.
093		So we can have just when the school per month, for example, where we just put the digital tools in the school.
093		Yes, I think that we can make the education with technology, but yes, we need to "instaur" some limits, like for example, one or two hours of time screen per day.
093		And so we also need to make some test in paper and pencil... based on paper and pencil for... 
093		yes, I think that's a good compromise for the...
093		Ok, Thank you.
093		yes why not
093		I think that we can make on computer like QCM, or... or just something like this
093		but I think that big test to be on paper and pencil to make the difference between technology and real test.
093		I think that's better on digital, if there is some restriction on the computer for example, so the students can't cheat at the test.
093		and It's more comfortable to students to make digital tests about computer science.
093		Yes
093		
093		No, nothing else to add 
115		and my number is 115 with role B
115		Yes, I find the technology is a good idea, but teens already have addiction to technology and screens devices.
115		So I don't find it a really good idea to import technology in school and make it all the day
115		Okay but do... you don't know they play games at home and play more games can be a little bit contradictory with addiction
115		Yeah I agree with you.
115		What do you think about the form of the education with technology?
115		Yes, but all students do not have a device to do homework at home. So do you have solution for that?
115		Okay, great. What about teacher? They don't have training for this new technology?
115		I find it's a good idea, a good concept, but there is some issue with that, like the cost of the... all the device and the cost of training teacher to that new technology.
115		Okay, I think we can find compromise to that import of technology in classroom.
115		I think we can use technology in classroom, but not all the day for all the week for all the month.
115		We need to keep a distance with technology in classroom to stay in the traditional way with pen and paper.
115		I agree with you
115		It's okay for me
115		Thank you too.
115		yes
115		say something else
115		do you think some exam can be made on a computer.
115		Yes, but for the exam on the... about the technology.
115		do you prefer exam on paper or on digital devices ?
115		Yes but the... I think the hardware test must be in paper.
115		The xxx theorical test.
115		yes, ok
115		do you have something else to speak
115		Ok, I think we have find a compromise
115		For this point
Ens		93, okay and your role is...
Ens		A, okay thank you
Ens		So you can start the timer when you're ready to 10 minutes with a ring at the end, okay.
Ens		Can you tell us the time please?
Ens		Would you like to say something else? Could you still have three and a half minutes?
