 it's exactly what i would like to see in our schools nowadays because they need these knowledges and we can bring them to them but it it's needed that it's in a controlled way because it could be so harmful for them and for the teachers because if the teachers doesn't know how to do it it will not help them if they just put the time with the computer and don't really know how to organize their own lessons
