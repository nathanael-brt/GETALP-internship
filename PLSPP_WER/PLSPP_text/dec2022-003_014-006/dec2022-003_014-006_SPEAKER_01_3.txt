 teachers who are now in this color system may not be born with the technology so they need to learn more about how to control it how to use it et cetera and it could cost very much because you need to install a lot of computers to help every pupil because if you want to put this system to help every student everyone should be at the same level so everyone should have a home computer provided by the school if it's possible and then it would be a so much expensive measure and then you need to hire a person to form the teachers how to use it and i think it could be so expensive for schools who don't have a lot of money from the system
