 yeah i totally understand what you're saying and so that's why we are helping the teachers with teacher coaches to help them better handle all the students in class to help them control everything that is done in the in the better way and also a few software applications that can help the teacher control what the well what all the students are doing in time so i honestly think that towards students that are often not very paying attention to class actually technology can help them to engage in the lesson way more because it can provide them other ways to communicate with their students around them
