 can be a problem okay i totally understand and that's a real issue that it needs to be worked on because when we take such big measures to change a system that's been working the same way for a long time we need to be aware of all the consequences that it can bring and of course cyber bullying and anxiety caused from being way too much on screens is an issue and we are aware of it so we actually make programs to help the parents and the students to control themselves and to have a better handling of what happens on the screens and of course it's an issue that we have to consider and in order to put this in place but i think that it really can help students to understand what society needs of them right now and what their future jobs need to be i just think that it has a lot of good impacts but of course we need to understand that the consequences can be harmful and so we need to control this in order to prevent it
