 okay i understand your point of view but for me i think that it could improve their capacities but it also could distract them while they're in class and they just look at the screen and for me and for trapeists also students and younger people are already too much in front of a screen heard before that they are six or eight hours per day in front of the screen and if new technologies are allowed in school we couldn't reduce this screen time
