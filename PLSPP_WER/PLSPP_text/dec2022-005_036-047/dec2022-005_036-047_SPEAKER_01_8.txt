 yes but you have to buy computers you have to teach a teacher how to use computer you have to say at some teacher that are old that are learning all of those teachers are not able to use computer because they learn school with books they learn school with writing at the hand so that means that we need to change everything and i think it's a little bit complicated in one second so i'll go with you with all what you said but we have to make a transition not to stop all of the work and to pass all of computers
