 yeah of course we need to put finances into our budget to finance all these projects and you think and of course education comes first before technology so in africa education even if it starts with book and then can involve with technology is more important but if we want them to really succeed they need to learn how to use all the tools they're going to use in their professional life that's why for me we need to increase our technology teaching but for that the teachers need to be formed as well they cannot just put the child in front of the computer and let them do their thing they need to guide them and that way we are not in the system where the teacher is only on the shelf and the students are behind him but it's more cooperative when the teacher only guides them and the students all self-learning or self-creating
