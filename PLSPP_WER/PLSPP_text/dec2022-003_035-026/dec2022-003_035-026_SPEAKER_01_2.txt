 yeah but maybe just for students who doesn't have the privilege to have a computer at home it could be a good opportunity for them to learn to use a computer at school because if they don't have it at home one day they will be in a firm where they will have to use their computer or software and hardware and they will not be able to do it so maybe especially for those children who lack technology at home maybe technology at school could have them
