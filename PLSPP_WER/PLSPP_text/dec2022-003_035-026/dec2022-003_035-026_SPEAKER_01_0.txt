 yeah i agree it's a bit expensive but i think we can manage to have state-step cities and grants so that we can buy some devices that can be useful for students for example interactive voice boards that can have some students with difficulties to stay focused especially human students who have difficulties or invert to drop out of school maybe a more technological way to make them learn is more easier make it easier for them to learn or to stay focused at school
