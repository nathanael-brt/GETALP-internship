 yeah that's a really interesting idea john it's a good idea because it's still a combination of normal traditional ways of learning and also screens like some said a teacher said that she used kagan structures which is a form of cooperative learning mode and also because they had little book clubs etc so they would use computers and tablets to learn a little bit more but they also had things outside of screens by interacting with others and learning at the same time
