 well yeah currently technology is a bit of a work in progress like you said technology has a real tool on mental health with anxiety low self-esteem sometimes depression and yeah some are more and more advantageous because their parents for example have high incomes compared to others that don't really have access to computers because their parents can't afford to so like i said before try and regulate it and also help by funding schools so that each student can be able to access computers in school and i think we should do that also because we have a lot of learning to do but also learning techniques are already present with technology like this topic of constructivism and inquiry based learning for example where students are taught to search for topics in themselves and teachers are there to guide them you can help with independence constructing a train of thoughts answering questions and understanding instructions
