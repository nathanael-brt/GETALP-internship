 yeah i remember a teacher a sixth grade teacher if i remember of the official middle school in the uk that said in her classes she used around one hour of her time for the students to go online to use the screens etc a little bit surprising don't found it don't find it find that because i think it's a little bit too much we should implement rules regarding the hours make sure they don't spend too much time and that the screens they are on doesn't replace it
