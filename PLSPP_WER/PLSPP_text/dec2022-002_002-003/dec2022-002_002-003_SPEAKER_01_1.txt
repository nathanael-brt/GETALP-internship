 well yeah building is one of the risks that is really evident with social media and the fact that students are using it more and more and that their parents are having problems regulating it because they don't really understand the principle so that is why we can also try and implement strict rules regarding the devices like an example was given of the fact that some teachers at the beginning of their classes used to ask questions to students and it would be easier for students to answer forums online and to make sure that those forums are only part of the school website for example and not used by everyone and of course strict regulation regarding may be curse words and make sure that there are filters etc
