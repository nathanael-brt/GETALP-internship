 i see but what i hear also is that it's a very expensive project like i said to buy the computers to keep the maintenance up everything i don't think every school that the state has the money for that in every school moreover when maintenance is needed you can't use the technology so you can also slow down the learning process while it's in maintenance could you repeat sorry while computers or technology devices are in maintenance they can't be used so it slows down the learning process
