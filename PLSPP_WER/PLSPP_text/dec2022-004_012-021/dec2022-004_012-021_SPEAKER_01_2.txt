 no because i'm not saying that robots can replace teachers i just think that the technology is a tool for teachers to help the students or the child to make more research it's a tool that they can use for example to go far away from what they know the teacher cannot know everything so when for example the works on the project are something they can use the technology to help them to work to reach new methods of working of teaching
