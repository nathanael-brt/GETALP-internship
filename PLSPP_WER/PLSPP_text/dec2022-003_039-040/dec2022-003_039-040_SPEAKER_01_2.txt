 yes we could but i also think that using technology is very important because we are facing a new generation a new world with new ways to learn and i think that we should adapt the school system to this it could increase their autonomy with more dialogue the professor won't be there just to stand here and talk and the students won't be passive anymore i think it's important for them to learn them to be active more active and to increase their autonomy
