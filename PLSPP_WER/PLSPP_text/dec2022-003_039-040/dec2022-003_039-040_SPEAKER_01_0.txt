 so i think that we should introduce technology to the classrooms and to the students i think it would be great since we live now in a world where technology is everywhere i think our students are going to have to experience some jobs that we don't know yet that even probably doesn't don't exist yet so i think that we really have to make them familiar with technology with computers with using them in their daily life so what do you think
