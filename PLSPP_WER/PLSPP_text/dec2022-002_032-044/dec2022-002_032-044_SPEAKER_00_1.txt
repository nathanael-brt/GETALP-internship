 yes but i see a true major problem but i understand that i think we will have a problem of cost because it's very expensive to have people to hire to be here for this information problem and you say you want to learn to teach maybe to solve this problem themselves but it's also very expensive to learn to them and i think you spoke about inequality but some low-income students will have technology in classrooms it's a good idea i have no problem but you don't think that when they come back at home if they don't have connection or good technology maybe they will be in a situation of inequality because of that it's a question or we can invest for exam for jk or was away i don't know but it's very expensive and this is a problem of money frankly
