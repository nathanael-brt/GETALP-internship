 okay i'm gonna defend the fact that the school should moderate the use of the technology in the classroom because there's a lot of negative point about it like it's not good things to be in-screen all day for a child because it can develop an anxiety and the child can become an anger more easily and they are not very concentrate when they are on a screen no one can really watch what they are doing in front of the screen so it can develop civil harassment so it's why it should be moderate
