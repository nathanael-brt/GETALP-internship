01		So I personally think that new technologies
01		aren't any good in class
01		and it should be
01		it should be something that is out of the school
01		and not in the school
01		there are 
01		two kind of
01		of situation
01		I think there is a
01		when there...
01		when there are
01		everyday new technologies
01		and it can
01		represent a distraction
01		and of course
01		on the other side
01		there can be like once a week
01		a class with computers
01		to learn new
01		technologies to the
01		students
01		Yes, but
01		we know for quite
01		a time now that
01		the ammount of time that teen
01		so students pass on
01		device and like smartphone,
01		computer
01		is a great
01		huge amount of time
01		like 6 to 8 hours
01		a day
01		so we do not need 
01		to increase this...
01		this time
01		This is a good point
01		money
01		if you want a new technology
01		in class this should be with great
01		equipment like you said
01		not necessarily
01		a computer per student
01		but
01		there will be some 
01		investment that we need
01		to do and of course
01		there will be
01		maybe
01		instruction of the teacher because not
01		all teacher
01		knows how to use keyboard
01		or computer
01		for their
01		course for
01		mathematic for example and
01		so there is
01		maybe inequality
01		between school that has the money
01		for this and school that 
01		doesn't have
01		I agree with you
01		so if the government
01		say that you will
01		invest in this
01		and of course...
01		of course give 
01		money to school that
01		doesn't have that much money
01		I can
01		eventually think
01		that some technology
01		on a certain level
01		with a minimum
01		amount of time
01		can be good
01		because
01		of course
01		this is not
01		all bad
01		Yes, but we have to
01		invest on it, but to invest we have to...
01		we need to have money and to make sure
01		that some 
01		people like government
01		or
01		or
01		other kind of people will help
01		and will do everything they can
01		so there isn't any
01		inequality between school
01		and between students because
01		this is the future
01		sorry, this is the future
01		of the country so if
01		some kids doesn't
01		have the same education
01		than other this will be
01		this will
01		increase inequality
01		Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation, technology can be slowly,
01		integrate in a classroom, but with regulation like I said, not every day, like once a week, for example,
01		to start, or like one hour a day or something like this.
00		Okay, I understand your point of view
00		but today the technology is quite important
00		because we need
00		computer to access to websites
00		or 
00		things like this and teacher has
00		need sorry, to show things to 
00		the class or things like this
00		I agree but I think that
00		the foudation 
00		priorities should be the
00		development of new way
00		with new 
00		technologies to learn and
00		to teach
00		for the 
00		kids it's an...
00		it's a better way to...
00		to learn
00		because they are more
00		happy
00		to be there
00		they enjoy
00		the class and for the
00		teachers it's
00		more simple because
00		they can
00		use a lot
00		of things and
00		diversify the...
00		how the...
00		how they work
00		I know, I agree with you but
00		technology is also
00		keyboard
00		or
00		the...
00		the things that can
00		project an image on the
00		keyboard
00		and it's not just the computer
00		so if we invest
00		in the
00		research of new technology
00		we may
00		discovery the new way
00		who
00		do not need to be on the
00		computer or Ipad
00		or something like this but
00		who can be technology and 
00		help the teacher
00		I know that and actually it
00		doesn't really
00		concern us it's
00		the government
00		who has to help
00		this school and this teacher
00		and also the parents because maybe
00		the child is
00		in a
00		great
00		school but he
00		may has no money
00		but it's the government who has
00		to help the...
00		the school
00		and we
00		should
00		offer them the
00		opportunity to...
00		to buy new stuff
00		okay
00		but maybe we should just talk
00		about this with... talk
00		about this with the
00		governments
00		for communication and
00		try to
00		see what we can do but I think
00		that even if we
00		don't know
00		what the government was going to
00		 say, we know 
00		that we have to
00		invest on your technology because 
00		it's
00		too
00		the government will...
00		will choose to
00		invest, it's 
00		an evidence becauset here is too many...
00		too many...
00		hum
00		too many
00		how to say it
00		that he
00		knows he has to do it because the
00		school need this for work, and work in a good way, because we saw that the child and the teacher are more...
00		are more... are happiest in the school when there is more technology.
00		Yes, I agree with you, because we all know that screen is bad for everyone, not just children.
00		And we, it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you said.
00		So we .. the teacher do this part, they have to adapt with the things that we offer to them.
00		And so we just had to agree with the fact that we invest, and that's it.
