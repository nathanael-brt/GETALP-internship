01		Yes, I find the technology is a good idea, but teens already have addiction to technology and screens devices.
01		So I don't find it a really good idea to import technology in school and make it all the day
01		Yes, but all students do not have a device to do homework at home. So do you have solution for that?
01		I find it's a good idea, a good concept, but there is some issue with that, like the cost of the... all the device and the cost of training teacher to that new technology.
01		Okay, I think we can find compromise to that import of technology in classroom.
01		I think we can use technology in classroom, but not all the day for all the week for all the month.
01		Yes, but for the exam on the... about the technology.
01		Yes, but for the exam on the... about the technology.
01		do you prefer exam on paper or on digital devices ?
00		Ok, So for me I think that technology is a good thing for the education because the kids or the children can
00		just learn something by make it a little bit more fun with games or something like this.
00		Yeah I see what you want to say, but I think that the parents need also to take a xxx and place some border to him at home.
00		And so we can make the school more funnier for the childrens.
00		I think that's... for this problem we can have some money and just put the education technology in the years, like in 10 years.
00		So we can have just when the school per month, for example, where we just put the digital tools in the school.
00		I think that's better on digital, if there is some restriction on the computer for example, so the students can't cheat at the test.
00		and It's more comfortable to students to make digital tests about computer science.
