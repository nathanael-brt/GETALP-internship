00		Good morning
00		so
00		We were asked to make suggestion to the supervisor
00		about the foundation priorities
00		I'm actually really in favor to develop technologies
00		really ? Well for me is like it's a tools
00		It's used in everyday life as a professional
00		or professionals use technologies every day
00		So we need to teach the students how to use it
00		in order for them to succeed in their professional life
00		Yeah, Yeah, I agree with you
00		That's why the school need to provide them
00		with computer and technology material
00		It's the school to provide them
00		such as the school provides the books
00		For example
00		Well, I disagree because it's an investments
00		Like book needs to be changed every two or three years
00		and you have to buy like a way... like a wide range of books
00		for every materials and for all the students
00		whereas when you have the computer
00		you only buy one computer and you have all the material on one computer
00		and it's used not for one students but for a lot of them
00		Well, it's more expensive but when students
00		degrades books they need to repay for it
00		so if they degrades the computer they will need to repay it
00		Well, maybe if the computer stays that school is safer for the material
00		like if they don't bring it at home
00		they only use it inside the school
00		maybe their are less risk to break it
00		Yeah, so for me, like, using technology is really important
00		and to develop like creativity and self learning
00		because it's more an intuitive way to learn
00		than just writing books and memorize information
00		and so it's more like the learning to make projects to do research
00		and stuff like that so we give them more trust
00		and there are more ability for them to learn
00		I disagree with you about that
00		it might be true about writing
00		whereas typing on the computer
00		but actually when you search the information yourself
00		you'll like more interested in the task
00		so you will retain the information better
00		Yeah but, school is not only about learning information
00		in order to put it in the exam
00		it's also about learning how to search, how to make a projects
00		how to create something and how to research the information
00		in order to learn more or to develop some competence
00		So for that I think the technology is the right tools and not books
00		Yeah, of course we need to put finances into our budget
00		to finance all this project
00		And of course education comes first before technologies
00		So in Africa, education even if it starts with book
00		and then can involve with technology is more important
00		but if we want them to really succeed
00		they need to learn how to use all the tools
00		they're going to use in their professional life
00		That's why for me we need to increase our technology teaching
00		but for that the teachers need to be formed as well
00		they cannot just put the child in front of the computer
00		and let them do their thing, they need to guide them
00		and that way we are not in the system where the teacher is on a shelf
00		and like the students are behind him
00		but it's more cooperative when the teacher only guide them
00		and the students all self learning or self-creating
00		yeah, not what I said
00		actually we just need to increase the work and the teaching we do with technologies
00		and the age of the teacher doesn't matter
00		actually teachers needs to be formed
00		because well science is always evolving for example
00		we're not saying that the earth is flat nowadays
00		so teachers always have to learn in order to teach
00		and if the teachers learn about technology the age of the teacher really doesn't matter
00		so for me it's really important and education is always about teaching and learning
00		whereas your a students or a teacher
01		And some professional are rich because they have a job
01		and they have a life, they have a family
01		And sometimes students
01		even where they are immigrants
01		for example
01		they don't have any money to buy a computer
01		and it's difficult for those people to use computer at school
01		Yes, but books are less expensive than computers
01		School can't buy all computers for all students
01		And if there is some degradation on the computer what you do
01		if some students break it or don't take care of computer
01		what you do? You change it and it's more expensive
01		that change your book
01		Yes, but repay a computer is too expensive for students
01		look at some manifestation in the street
01		where students are poor
01		ask for money, ask for money for buy food
01		for buy an habitation and it's not possible for student to buy a computer
01		as they want
01		So you want to make a mix like at school computer
01		and at home books
01		Yes, but some studies show that we learn better with a book
01		while we're reading that while we're typing or we're searching on the internet
01		So it's more difficult for students to learn by a computer
01		than if they read a book
01		Yes, but you can also search the information in the book
01		and you can write it in... by your hand
01		and it will be better for your memory
01		by my personal experience
01		I know that to learn something I had to read it, I had to learn it
01		and if I only type it on the computer I can't go to exam and succeed
01		I agree but look, in... for example in... we are not in Africa but in Africa
01		they can't have a book already
01		and if we want to reorganize the school system
01		that mean that some people that can't buy a book
01		have to buy a computer, it's impossible
01		Yes, but you have to buy computers
01		you have to teach teacher how to use computer
01		you have to say at some teacher that are old
01		that are learning some... all of those teacher are not able to use computer
01		because they learn school with books
01		they are learn school with writing at the hand
01		so that's mean that we need to change everything
01		and I think it's a little bit complicated in one second
01		so we... I agree with you with all what you said
01		but we have to make a transition
01		not to stop all of book and to pass all of computers
01		a little bit not too more
01		because it's dangerous for for economic of family
01		for economic of school it's a
