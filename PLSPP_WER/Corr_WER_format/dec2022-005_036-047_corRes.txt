00		Good morning so We were asked to make suggestion to the supervisor about the foundation priorities I'm actually really in favor to develop technologies really ? Well for me is like it's a tools It's used in everyday life as a professional or professionals use technologies every day So we need to teach the students how to use it in order for them to succeed in their professional life 
00		Yeah, Yeah, I agree with you That's why the school need to provide them with computer and technology material It's the school to provide them such as the school provides the books For example 
00		Well, I disagree because it's an investments Like book needs to be changed every two or three years and you have to buy like a way... like a wide range of books for every materials and for all the students whereas when you have the computer you only buy one computer and you have all the material on one computer and it's used not for one students but for a lot of them 
00		Well, it's more expensive but when students degrades books they need to repay for it so if they degrades the computer they will need to repay it 
00		Well, maybe if the computer stays that school is safer for the material like if they don't bring it at home they only use it inside the school maybe their are less risk to break it 
00		Yeah, so for me, like, using technology is really important and to develop like creativity and self learning because it's more an intuitive way to learn than just writing books and memorize information and so it's more like the learning to make projects to do research and stuff like that so we give them more trust and there are more ability for them to learn 
00		I disagree with you about that it might be true about writing whereas typing on the computer but actually when you search the information yourself you'll like more interested in the task so you will retain the information better 
00		Yeah but, school is not only about learning information in order to put it in the exam it's also about learning how to search, how to make a projects how to create something and how to research the information in order to learn more or to develop some competence So for that I think the technology is the right tools and not books 
00		Yeah, of course we need to put finances into our budget to finance all this project And of course education comes first before technologies So in Africa, education even if it starts with book and then can involve with technology is more important but if we want them to really succeed they need to learn how to use all the tools they're going to use in their professional life That's why for me we need to increase our technology teaching but for that the teachers need to be formed as well they cannot just put the child in front of the computer and let them do their thing, they need to guide them and that way we are not in the system where the teacher is on a shelf and like the students are behind him but it's more cooperative when the teacher only guide them and the students all self learning or self-creating 
00		yeah, not what I said actually we just need to increase the work and the teaching we do with technologies and the age of the teacher doesn't matter actually teachers needs to be formed because well science is always evolving for example we're not saying that the earth is flat nowadays so teachers always have to learn in order to teach and if the teachers learn about technology the age of the teacher really doesn't matter so for me it's really important and education is always about teaching and learning whereas your a students or a teacher 
01		And some professional are rich because they have a job and they have a life, they have a family And sometimes students even where they are immigrants for example they don't have any money to buy a computer and it's difficult for those people to use computer at school 
01		Yes, but books are less expensive than computers School can't buy all computers for all students 
01		And if there is some degradation on the computer what you do if some students break it or don't take care of computer what you do? You change it and it's more expensive that change your book 
01		Yes, but repay a computer is too expensive for students look at some manifestation in the street where students are poor ask for money, ask for money for buy food for buy an habitation and it's not possible for student to buy a computer as they want 
01		So you want to make a mix like at school computer and at home books 
01		Yes, but some studies show that we learn better with a book while we're reading that while we're typing or we're searching on the internet So it's more difficult for students to learn by a computer than if they read a book 
01		Yes, but you can also search the information in the book and you can write it in... by your hand and it will be better for your memory by my personal experience I know that to learn something I had to read it, I had to learn it and if I only type it on the computer I can't go to exam and succeed 
01		I agree but look, in... for example in... we are not in Africa but in Africa they can't have a book already and if we want to reorganize the school system that mean that some people that can't buy a book have to buy a computer, it's impossible 
01		Yes, but you have to buy computers you have to teach teacher how to use computer you have to say at some teacher that are old that are learning some... all of those teacher are not able to use computer because they learn school with books they are learn school with writing at the hand so that's mean that we need to change everything and I think it's a little bit complicated in one second so we... I agree with you with all what you said but we have to make a transition not to stop all of book and to pass all of computers 
01		a little bit not too more because it's dangerous for for economic of family for economic of school it's a
