01		Yes, but don't you think that the children's
01		only use technology at school isn't too much
01		and they have to continue to write with their hands
01		and don't only use the new technology?
01		Okay, so it's going to be a transition.
01		Yeah, so maybe what we can do is
01		for certain class trying to use it.
01		Yeah, to test, like test.
01		And if it's beneficial or not,
01		maybe we will introduce it in the...
01		for the new generations.
01		And if it doesn't work
01		in the... for the new generations,
01		is it not depends that we could evitate
01		and, for example,
01		and, for example,
01		use this money that we used for children
01		who doesn't have the chance to learn,
01		like in some certain poor country,
01		rather than use it for our school,
01		that we have...
01		There is problem.
01		If there is connection problem in a class,
01		the teacher cannot make his class.
01		For example, you know,
01		there is a risk that you don't have
01		with a traditional way of learning.
01		Yeah, but I still think it's not a good idea
01		because you lose the...
01		you don't have the discussion with the teacher,
01		you don't have the...
01		you will lose all your...
01		your abilities to go and have a discussion
01		with another people except behind the computer.
01		In the...
01		when you're gonna work in your professional life,
01		you will have to discuss with, for example,
01		a client if you go in commercial way.
01		So I think you have to...
01		to use technology because, yeah,
01		I agree it's important for our generation.
01		So 100%.
01		But we have to stay with the traditional way.
01		Because I think that they have to continue writing
01		because the jobs that use the write will continue.
01		So I think it would be great to moderate
01		between new technology and like old school.
01		Yeah, but there is a problem that scientifist proved
01		that and like therapist proved that use technology at school,
01		even children's use technology out from school.
01		So they use at school, out from school,
01		and it developed the anxiety for example,
01		and it can develop depression if they don't have access
01		to the technology.
01		So I think they get,
01		we have to make a balance between school and not school.
01		we have to make a balance between school and not school.
01		So we can make different classes, for example,
01		like if the parents want because they,
01		this is their choice when childrens are young
01		and make different class.
01		Yeah but I don't think that... for little parts,
01		yes, they will use it correctly,
01		but most of the children will want to go on Netflix
01		but most of the children will want to go on Netflix
01		on YouTube and it's gonna be a distraction
01		more than a real service..
01		make the transition and use technology
01		and if the teacher doesn't want to use it,
01		he will not use it correctly.
01		And I think it's just a transition
01		of what he knows before
01		and just with technology.
01		So it's not necessary useful.
01		But who is going to pay for all this equipment?
01		The school or the parents
01		because it represents huge depense.
01		So not everyone can do it for their children.
01		It represents a big difficulty.
01		Yes, and I think it's not possible
01		in a crisis, if there is a war
01		like actually in Ukraine,
01		there is repercussion in every country.
01		If we, in France, we want to did this
01		to put the technology at school,
01		the state cannot finance for any...
01		the state cannot finance for any...
01		So you have to go back and use the old technical.
01		So I think it's not certain, like
01		You cannot, for the moment, use it
01		because it's too expensive.
01		Teachers are still old.
01		Maybe next generations
01		because they were born with this,
01		maybe they will use it correctly.
01		But I think for the moment it's not possible.
00		So I think that we should introduce technology
00		to the classrooms and to the students.
00		I think it would be great since we live now in a world
00		where technology is everywhere.
00		I think our students are going to have
00		to experience some jobs that we don't know yet
00		that even probably doesn't... don't exist yet.
00		So I think that we really have to make them familiar
00		with technology, with computers, with...
00		and with using them in their daily life.
00		So what do you think?
00		I think we're speaking of our country
00		in that right now in our country,
00		mostly pretty much everyone has the chance to go to school
00		and to learn.
00		So this is now we have to try new things.
00		Maybe to help the poorest people
00		so they can have it later.
00		Of course, it's gonna be difficult.
00		But we can't know if we just spend money
00		on something that won't work.
00		If we don't try, we cannot know if it's gonna work or not.
00		If we don't try.
00		Yes, it can happen, of course.
00		I think this is why we should put some experts
00		on every school that could be able to
00		make any intervention at any moment
00		to solve the problem if it exists.
00		This is why I told you it has to be well organized.
00		If it's done just not...
00		If we don't put enough energy in it, it won't work.
00		This is why we have to put a lot of money right now
00		so it works well.
00		And then we're gonna maybe be able
00		to have this technologic system that will work
00		and it's going to be beneficial for everyone.
00		Yeah, I agree.
00		We have to keep nourishing the relationship between people.
00		We don't have to be like...
00		prisoned and...
00		under the computer and everything.
00		Yes, you're right.
00		We have to make a dialogue, a discussion
00		between the teacher that will be here to help the children
00		not only to learn them like magistrarly,
00		just to discuss with them.
00		To increase the autonomy of the children
00		and their capacity to communicate with each other.
00		I don't think that we have to make them use
00		only technology, making them use it doesn't mean
00		that they won't be writing or anything beside,
00		they don't have to do it all the time.
00		Yes, we could, but I also think that using technology
00		is very important because we are facing a new generation,
00		a new world with new ways to learn.
00		And I think that we should adapt the school system to this.
00		It could increase their autonomy.
00		With more dialogue, the professor won't be there
00		just to stand here and talk and students
00		won't be passive anymore.
00		I think it's important for them to learn them,
00		to be active, more active, and to increase their autonomy.
00		Yes, I think that's interesting.
00		And I agree with you, they use screens
00		and internet and computers all the time.
00		It's a generation who was born with this
00		and who knows it may be better than us.
00		And I think that we should learn them how to make good things
00		and to use these computers and all these screens
00		usefully.
00		We have to learn them how to make it good,
00		how to do good things with it, how to use them
00		and use them to help them,
00		like even in the work at work at school,
00		because now the children are using these screens
00		and everything mostly to do not to work
00		to divertissement and everything.
00		So I think it's important to learn them how to work with it
00		and how to make it useful.
00		Yeah, I think this is how... this is why the teachers are important
00		and this is why they are here
00		and they have to be well trained to involve to the children
00		the value of it that they have a chance
00		to have these... I don't know, these computers and this technology.
00		And I think that if we learn them how to use them correctly
00		and not only for Netflix and everything
00		and playing games and everything,
00		I think that it can only be great.
00		They will know how to make it great.
00		Yeah, this is how... this why sorry, we have to put a lot of financial resources
00		on this project to form correctly the teachers
00		so they actually know what to do
00		and not just do what they usually did on a computer
00		because this is nonsense,
00		this is not useful at all.
00		We have to form... to train the teacher well
00		so they can transmit to the children the right thing
00		what we want them to do.
00		Yeah, this is how I think we should have a discussion
00		with the state and big associations
00		and everything to have... to be allowed to afford it
00		and to offer everyone the same chances
00		to use technology usefully.
00		Well, I think it's something that will take a long time.
00		Of course, we cannot do it in a few years
00		and just it's not that fast.
00		It cannot be that fast.
00		But I think that on the long term,
00		we will be able to do this.
00		Of course, it will take a bit of time,
00		but this is now we have to start it.
00		Of course, but it has to be well done.
00		And we don't have to discriminate any children.
00		We can test on a few classes.
00		But as it works when it's well done,
00		I think we should now start to think about finance this in priority.
00		Because I think this is the future.
00		We have a generation that was born with this technology
00		and we have to adapt with it.
00		So maybe, I don't know, maybe,
00		abandon old system progressively
00		to, at the end,
00		to end up with this technology system being the main one.
