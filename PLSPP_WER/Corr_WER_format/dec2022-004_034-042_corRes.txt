01		I agree with you to keep using books papers and traditional way of learning but in my opinion technology provides extensive opportunities for students it's a way for them to develop new skills and their creativity by using devices like tablets, computers etc and it's a new way of learning for them it can develop their interest for what we we are studying and like you said they already use 
01		it can develop their interest for what we we are studying and like you said they already use electronical devices so developing learning by technology is really in our area and that's why I think we should develop that point in the school 
01		yes I agree we should limit the use of technology in school like two hours per day maybe that could be interesting to to experiment that way of learning  
01		 yes I totally agree with you, I think it could be necessary to learn to parents and students the dangers of internet the extreme use of electronical devices on health for example on the eyes, on concentration etc 
01		yes or another solution is to ask parents if they have electronical devices at home and for the students who don't have electronic devices to do homework maybe school can provide us them a computer to to do their homeworks for example if they have to do expose that could be a solution for them to to work at home with technology  
01		what time do you think we should impose to use technology at school 
01		okay and in what... in what class do you think we should use it for example plastic art mathematics English  
01		okay I agree I think we should put in place two hours per day for these classes 
00		I think technology is the future, but she have many many problems because the students are already exposed to this technology out of the school, so that's why I think we should moderate that use and maybe we can put a 
00		moderate that use and maybe we can put a plage of of of hours still for example one hour for the day and after we continue the 
00		plage of of of hours still for example one hour for the day and after we continue the traditional way exercise like papers and books and... 
00		yes but what do you think about the psychology of our students if we expose too much our students to technology we know that it's a possibility for them to develop anxiety and I think that can degrade their their relationships so I think we have to take this in consideration and maybe don't put them really faster to the technology right now, ok 
00		what do you think about a class of sensibilization we could make a place of sensibilization for parents and for students to show us the danger of the technology and maybe debate of the benefits and the ... 
00		and there is another thing we are not really agree for the technology using in school I hope the technology will not 
00		use for the homework because there is disparity social and I think that some student are not the capacity or the materials way to have a computer at their home or so I think it's important to let the technology in into school 
00		you said two hours per day I am agree with that solution because I think two hours is not too much one hour is... is not enough okay but two hours you have the time to make many things and I think it's enough 
00		okay I think we can use for mathematics French lesson just for grammar, you know, exercise. When it's about redaction I prefer paper of course but for just simple exercises computer technology is great way and mathematics of course physical one is possible SVT you can okay well you can use the technology for see video and it is more you know attractive for student
