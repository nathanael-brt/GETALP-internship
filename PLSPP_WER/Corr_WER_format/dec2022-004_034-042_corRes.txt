01		I agree with you to keep using books papers and traditional way of learning but in my opinion technology
01		provides extensive opportunities for students it's a way for them to develop new skills and their
01		creativity by using devices like tablets, computers etc and it's a new way of learning for them
01		it can develop their interest for what we we are studying and like you said they already use
01		it can develop their interest for what we we are studying and like you said they already use
01		electronical devices so developing learning by technology is really in our area and that's why I think
01		we should develop that point in the school
01		yes I agree we should limit the use of technology in school like two hours per day maybe
01		that could be interesting to to experiment that way of learning 
01		 yes I totally agree with you, I think it could be necessary to learn to parents and students the dangers of internet the
01		extreme use of electronical devices on health for example on the eyes, on concentration etc
01		yes or another solution is to ask parents if they have
01		electronical devices at home and for the students who don't have electronic devices to do homework
01		maybe school can provide us them a computer to to do their homeworks for example if they have to
01		do expose that could be a solution for them to to work at home with technology 
01		what time do you think we should impose to use technology at school
01		okay and in what... in what class do you think we should use it for example plastic art mathematics English 
01		okay I agree I think we should put in place two hours per day for
01		these classes
00		I think technology is the future, but she have many many problems because the students
00		are already exposed to this technology out of the school, so that's why I think we should
00		moderate that use and maybe we can put a
00		moderate that use and maybe we can put a
00		plage of of of hours still for example one hour for the day and after we continue the
00		plage of of of hours still for example one hour for the day and after we continue the
00		traditional way exercise like papers and books and...
00		yes but what do you think about the psychology of our
00		students if we expose too much our students to technology we know that it's a possibility for them
00		to develop anxiety and I think that can degrade their their relationships so I think we have
00		to take this in consideration and maybe don't put them really faster to the technology right now, ok
00		what do you think about a class of sensibilization we could make a place of sensibilization for parents and for students to show us
00		the danger of the technology and maybe debate of the benefits and the ...
00		and there is another thing we are not really agree for the technology using in school
00		I hope the technology will not
00		use for the homework because there is disparity social and I think that some student are not
00		the capacity or the materials way to have a computer at their home or so I think it's important to let the technology in into school
00		you said two hours per day I am agree with that solution because I think two hours is not
00		too much one hour is... is not enough okay but two hours you have the time to make many things and I think it's enough
00		okay I think we can use for mathematics French
00		lesson just for grammar, you know, exercise. When it's about redaction I prefer paper of course but for just
00		simple exercises computer technology is great way and mathematics of course physical one is
00		possible SVT you can okay well you can use the technology for see video and it is more you know attractive for student
