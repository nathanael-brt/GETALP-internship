00		role B So in my opinion it's necessary to develop the technology in high school and in every high school because that allow to improve the knowledge of the students and it's a good point for their future job and studies in university or something like that O-K but I 
00		Yeah but I think it's important to to x-x-x this gap between the different high school because I'm agree with you Everybody can have access to the technology student from poor high school or very good high school There is no different for me Everybody have the right to access of all the technology and it's necessary 
00		can they do their homework for example Yes but for that I think the state can make a decision to put the budget and allowed all the high school to have good tool technologies like computer good system informatics system et-cetera 
00		Maybe we can help this old teacher with give them formation and 
00		some teachers specialized in informatic and new technology can help them to be formed from that new 
00		Yeah maybe it's difficult to spend a lot of time to be formed of this new technology so but it's dramatic because I think it's good for students because they can help them to develop their abilities to resolve problems and to improve their knowledge about this type of technology 
00		not a It's need to be x-x-x maybe because there is good points and bad points So you can we can just we cannot just drop this form of new this new system Just like that we need to improve to inform everybody students teachers everybody To my 
00		and pen to write to read too For develop this new system we can begin with one for example one hour per days with computer and new technology but keep going with the old method with paper pen because technology have also her limit because in my opinion it's more easy to learn a lesson with paper or without 
01		understand what you say but I think that it's not possible in all school because there is there are some schools who don't have the money 
01		be necessary but if students didn't have a computer their own computer how can 
01		O-K it's a good idea but this is not the only problem There is also 
01		new form of scholarship Yes but new technology is not easy and they need really lot of time to really understand how it works and it's not really we don't have lot of time to teach them how to use it 
01		technology Yes but studies shows too that students who use new technology in school develops anxiety So it's not 
01		opinion we need to reduce the time the students spend on computers television on just sorry to reduce this time because they spend too much time on this at home and if they are on computer at school too there will be too much time for them and I think it's a problem They need to return at paper and 
01		to add a little of new technology on class maybe one or two hour per day but we can keep also traditional way to teach
