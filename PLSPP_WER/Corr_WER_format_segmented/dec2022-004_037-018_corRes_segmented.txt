00		i personally think that incorporating technologies in our class could cause more harm than good first because its very expensive and maybe our school is not able to afford that kind of technologies 
00		yes but there are some i agree with you but there are some costs that need that are too expensive to be made per example there are some rural areas that arent equipped with a very good internet connection and building a good internet connection would cost a lot 
00		there are a lot of disparities between people who can afford a computer and people who cannot afford a computer and people who are who have who doesnt have the money for it are not used to use computers so they will be not at the same level as people who already know how to use a computer so they will have to be trained even more 
00		students will just use the computers as a teaching method and not really interact with their teachers or interact with other students or being on the computer all day long can lead to a lack of social skills or anxiety or being very dependent on the computer and not on classic teaching methods 
00		yeah like probably only use computers only a few hours a day or during certains lessons or we could also just use computers at school and not at home to prevent 
01		hello so we need to make some suggestions to your to the hello we need to make some suggestions to our superior about the new technology in teaching what do you think about that 
01		about the cost of the technologies i think personally if we make a good plan so we make a big invest first but we make a good update plan so we doesnt need to remake a big invest later and it can reduce the cost because we doesnt have to recruit to technology experts if a troubleshooting appears but yes their are some cost in maintenance etc 
01		yes but if we make a good internet connection for example we can increase the skill of our students because we can make an evolution of our teaching like a teacher can give a subject to a student and a student with a good internet connection can make research about the subject and thats really great for the teaching and for the students and can add some interest for the students because some students cannot be interest by teaching on paper and pencil 
01		yes there are some cost to train the teacher or the students but if we make if we train the teacher if we make a big investment of new technology if the students add interest of our teaching and yes there are some disparities but we can help the students with a computer we lead to us or etc and we can so increase our skills and now we are in the 21st century and the computer is the a skills who need to be know because we use allday computers like for typing for presenting and presentation etc 
01		yes yes but we can also create book clubs or writing clubs the students can read a book or can try to write etc and thats good for the assessment but we need also to 
01		to remake the assessment with a computer for example we can make an assessment with computer if we may give some computer on students at their assessments and could be great for us 
01		so we can make a transition between the paper and pencil and the technology we can make some transition step by step on with incorporating technology little by little on our teaching its could be great 
01		yes the students can only use the computer on technology lesson for example or for a mathematical lesson for example that could be a good transition for incorporate technology in your teaching and also make our school modern with some technologies
