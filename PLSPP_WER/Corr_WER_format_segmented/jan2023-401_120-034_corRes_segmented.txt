01		okay so we should write some article about animal testing what do you think about it what the angle we 
01		okay so alternative we write our article about the three r and you do your research about the 
01		you can you can you can write wait wait wait wait wait wait we have to write an article and choose an angle so you can write its outdated i can write no no no listen to me you write its outdated i write we still do it and we write the three rs method read deal 
01		problem because i disagree i think we should write this article in favor of animal testing because this method allow breakthrough in science and research for scientific and to understanding the human body and human disease and everything so for me animal testing is the right method to allow the humanity to have a better life with understanding this function 
01		but we can do that rehumanize our science and using animals like in a better way that before 
01		no because we have alternatives but like for example human disease sometimes we dont have the correct alternative like for example alzheimers no alzheimers the case of alzheimers in the 
01		cure mice who have alzheimers but we cannot translate it for now at the human because we didnt understand the molecular basis but to take alternative we can use for example computer alternative but to use it we have to understands the molecular basis so if we dont have the molecular basis we cannot use alternative before you have to 
01		what money we have the subventions because we are legally we have legally the obligation to do animal testing its right in a lot of xxx treatment 
01		yes but like i said its not about efficient and increase the development its about reality and reality and 
01		reality and reality and point of the world its like if you dont understand the basis you cannot create so no we dont know the basis ok 
01		so we dont have the basis so whe have to find it maybe maybe youre right and maybe we can take the point of 
01		we have to find alternative but we cannot skip the animal testing 
00		i think i have a clear clear clear clear position about the animal testing i just think this is an archaic method completely outdated and we have to just think about how we can did doing do these experiences without animal testing because thats just wasting money for nothing because any solution could replaced these animal testing 
00		between us human we that we are just exploiting the rest of nature its just outdated it was in the 19th in the 20th century okay it was great and we understand the functionment of 
00		okay may i correct you just in one point maybe in the past it 
00		last the last sentence oh you are you are you are hard you are hard but we are okay to say that 25 years to skip the animal testing is too okay 
00		we are continuating to kill any day 
00		what do you think what do you think about to create a processus of experimentation in vitro by example for in the same time and in the second time we can effectively create a program in computer modellization which are very very very performant more maybe more in the in the lot of time more performant that animal testing where computering computer modellization are more efficient in a lot of time that so we could 
00		okay it was the past we did animal testing and we know the functionment of our body and the body and the and cellular that that create disease et cetera okay but now its time to transit to a way of science which are more human and when we didnt talk about money 
00		yes yes but a lot of there there is more subvention as you say to have when we are when we are in the program in the rs program in the rs program rs program you know with the xxx the three r so if we are coming in rs program three r we have more subventions and that could be a transition step between between the the experience with animals and without animal but i just want to to say one one one one thing one fact 26 billions of dollar that have been invest in experience animal testing and just 95 percent did not succeed who didnt translate the medicant for human that we test on animals this is really close and this is and we could put all this money on computing computer modelization 
00		oh sorry im not in scientifical lessons or grades or so so i dont know 
00		im okay with the three rs maybe maybe maybe an acceleration an acceleration of the three r because to when the three r have been created 15th in the 15th 1950 
00		no we have to create the acceleration of three r that could be the three r speedy the speedy 
00		you want to skip the animal testing in the in 25 years this is outdated anthropologically anthropologically create a
