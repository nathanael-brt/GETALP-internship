00		so we are here to defend our position on the foundation priority that could be in matter of technology in the classroom for me i think that technology in school could harm more than be good for students for me schools should be moderate their utilization of new technology 
00		okay i understand you point of view but for me i think that it can it could improve their capacities but it also could distract them when they are in class and they just look at the screen and i for me and for therapists also students and young people are already too much in front of a screen we can heard before that they are six or eight hours per day in front of screen and if new technologies are allowed in school we couldnt reduce this screen time 
00		do you think that technologies can interest students more than if they are just with a pen 
00		i couldnt agree more with you in this point and i think we can we could have a compromise with this for me i think that a little time of screen in school couldnt be couldnt have bad effect on students because they have to live with their time but i think school should moderate their use 
00		okay yeah i agree with you on this and for you what is the perfect time in a day for students 
00		i agree with you with that and i also think that if there are more than one or two hours per day in front of a screen like the therapist encourage this students could have a addiction to technologies and their screen and their phone 
00		i agree with you on this and to talk about another point what do you think technology could do between students who dont have a lot of money and dont have access to technologies and the students who already is who already had a phone a computer and 
00		yeah yeah i understand what you just said so to sum up we agreed that one hour of technology and screen per day in a school its okay its not too much to 
01		okay so in my opinion the technology in school is not harm but is like an experience and a thing to improve the learn of these students and the 
01		yes its a good condition for students i think and to concludes yes technology its create disparities but its also creates good moments for students and they can just enjoying to stand up for in school and thats my point 
01		i could considerate that can distract students but i think the students enjoying the learn and they can be more i dont know but 
01		yes its like they are in her own house and its more familiar for him to take technologies and to simply 
01		yes they need to restrict the time of the students in the screen because i think the students can be more able to deal with if they have a good situation to use it simple 
01		for me i think thats half an hour for day its a good time for students because extend this time the students were not concentrated in the school 
01		yes meanwhile the school some students have an addiction with the screen and the school 
01		didnt so i and the school have a goal and this goal is to learn and i think thats the learning can be pass with the screen with technology but its not the only goal of school its not the school of technology its school of so its school to learn not to distract 
01		i think its create disparities between a school who have technology in who have technology and these disparities need to be 
01		i think because if we create disparities we need to involve the fact that we can have people with or not technology and its simply to 
01		to school to create an environment for enjoy technology at school and not just for show us the disparity between this person or this person who have technology and who havent
