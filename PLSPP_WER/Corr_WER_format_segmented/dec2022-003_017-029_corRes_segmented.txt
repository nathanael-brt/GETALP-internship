00		i personally think that have technology in classes its a new perspective of teaching and it enables students to be curious and search information online on topics they like and also ecologically speaking its good for environment because we dont have to use paper so i think its quite good 
00		im listening to your point but i think it have this topic of technology in classes has pros and cons and youre telling and cons that is harassment but i think that things could be put to avoid harassment i dont have solutions 
00		i have mixed feelings about that because i think that technology can allow children or students and teachers to have a dialogue another dialogue from the classic school and i think also that now with the development of data its more practical to search online things than in books 
00		i dont know but its allow to do a certain how do you say 
00		you say you can follow the line and i think its great to have technology in school and at home because for children its 
00		and for sorry and for teachers its a new perspective to teach and its interesting for them 
00		yes the fact is that teachers in their childhood in the last decades werent abilitate to use technology because it didnt exist but the thing is that they can now be coached and they can intern learn to children who dont know how to proceed 
00		i think one or two hours per day or per weeks its a good thing 
01		okay im gonna defend the fact that the school should moderate the use of the technology in the classroom because theres a lot of negative point about it like its not a good thing to be inscreen all day for a child because it s can develop anxiety and the child can become anger more usually and theyre not very concentrate when theyre on a screen no one can really watch what theyre doing in front of the screen so it can develop cyber harassment so its why it should be moderate 
01		well what about the moderation of the use because of the cyber harassment that can be made of 
01		but dont you think that people must not be very concentrate when theyre not in front of the screen you know what i mean when the teacher is speaking in a traditional way that you will think okay lets not be concentrate now and be concentrate on the screen because its fun and its 
01		what about the anxiety the anger and all the negative points that the studies show of the screen dont you think that allow children who at home is usually on the screen come to class also a screen is a good thing for the development of the child or not 
01		are who dont really use the teacher the old teacher who dont really use the screen or everything and when you ask them to teach with the things that they didnt know how to use 
01		a compromise i listen what you are saying and i think that the screen is a good thing but it should be moderate im not its not a no for me to be used at school but it should be moderate because of everything that is the consequence of the using of the screen 
01		yeah and not no more it should be a the traditional way should be used and not only on the screen
