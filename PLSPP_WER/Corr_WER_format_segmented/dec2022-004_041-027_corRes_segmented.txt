00		so in my opinion its necessary to develop the technology in high school and in every high school because that allow to improve the knowledge of the students and its a good point for their future job and studies in university or something like that 
00		yeah but i think its important to to xxx this gap between the different high school because im agree with you everybody can have access to the technology student from poor high school or very good high school there is no different for me everybody have the right to access of all the technology and its necessary for me 
00		yes but for that i think the state can make a decision to put the budget and allowed all the high school to have good tool technologies like computer good system informatics system etc 
00		maybe we can help this old teacher with give them formation and 
00		some teachers specialized in informatic and new technology can help them to be formed from that new form of scholarship 
00		maybe its difficult to spend a lot of time to be formed of this new technology so but its dramatic because i think its good for students because they can help them to develop their abilities to resolve problems and to improve their knowledge about this type of technology 
00		be xxx maybe because there is good points and bad points so you can we can just we cannot just drop this form of new this new system just like that we need to improve to inform everybody 
00		for develop this new system we can begin with one for example one hour per days with computer and new technology but keep going with the old method with paper pen because technology have also her limit because in my opinion its more easy to learn a lesson with paper or without a screen 
01		i understand what you say but i think that its not possible in all school because there is there are some schools who dont have 
01		if students didnt have a computer their own computer how can they do their homework for example 
01		ok its a good idea but this is not the only problem there is also 
01		yes but new technology is not easy and they need really lot of time to really understand how it works and its not really we dont have lot of time to teach them how to use it 
01		yes but studies shows too that students who use new technology in school develops anxiety 
01		to my opinion we need to reduce the time the students spend on computers television on just sorry to reduce this time because they spend too much time on this at home and if they are on computer at school too there will be too much time for them and i think its a problem they need to return at paper and pen to write to read too 
01		to add a little of new technology on class maybe one or two hour per day but we can keep also traditional way to teach
