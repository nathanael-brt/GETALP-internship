00		yes but dont you think that the childrens only use technology at school isnt too much and they have to continue to write with their hands and dont only use the new technology 
00		okay so its going to be a transition yeah so maybe what we can do is for certain class trying to use it 
00		yeah to test like test and if its beneficial or not maybe we will introduce it in the for the new generations 
00		and if it doesnt work in the for the new generations is it not depends that we could evitate and 
00		for example use this money that we used for children who doesnt have the chance to learn like in some certain poor country rather than use it for our school that we have 
00		there is problem if there is connection problem in a class the teacher cannot make his class for example you know there is a risk that you dont have with a traditional way of learning 
00		yeah but i still think its not a good idea because you lose the you dont have the discussion with the teacher you dont have the you will lose all your 
00		your abilities to go and have a discussion with another people except behind the computer in the when youre gonna work in your professional life you will have to discuss with for example a client if you go in commercial way so i think you have to to use technology because yeah i agree its important for our generation so 
00		because i think that they have to continue writing because the jobs that use the write will continue so i think it would be great to moderate between new technology and like old school 
00		yeah but there is a problem that scientifist proved that and like therapist proved that use technology at school even childrens use technology out from school so they use at school out from school and it developed the anxiety for example and it can develop depression if they dont have access to the technology so i think they get we have to 
00		we have to make a balance between school and not school so we can make different classes 
00		yeah but i dont think that for little parts yes they will use it correctly but most of the children will 
00		want to go on netflix on youtube and its gonna be a distraction 
00		make the transition and use technology and if the teacher doesnt want to use it he will not use it correctly and i think its just a transition of what he knows before and just with technology so its not necessary useful 
00		but who is going to pay for all this equipment the school or the parents because it represents huge depense so not everyone can do it for their children it represents a big difficulty 
00		and i think its not possible in a crisis if there is a war like actually in ukraine there is repercussion in every country if we in france we want to did this to put the technology at school the state cannot finance for 
00		so you have to go back and use the old technical so i think its not certain like you cannot for the moment use it because its too expensive teachers are still old maybe next generations because they were born with this maybe they will use it correctly but i think for the moment its not possible 
01		so i think that we should introduce technology to the classrooms and to the students i think it would be great since we live now in a world where technology is everywhere i think our students are going to have to experience some jobs that we dont know yet that even probably doesnt dont exist yet so i think that we really have to make them familiar with technology with computers with and with using them in their daily life so what do you think 
01		i think were speaking of our country in that right now in our country mostly pretty much everyone has the chance to go to school and to learn so this is now we have to try new things maybe to help the poorest people so they can have it later of course its gonna be difficult but we cant know if we just spend money on something that wont work if we dont try we cannot know if its gonna work or not if we dont try 
01		yes it can happen of course i think this is why we should put some experts on every school that could be able to make any intervention at any moment to solve the problem if it exists this is why i told you it has to be well organized if its done just not if we dont put enough energy in it it wont work this is why we have to put a lot of money right now so it works well and then were gonna maybe be able to have this technologic system that will work and its going to be beneficial for everyone 
01		yeah i agree we have to keep nourishing the relationship between people we dont have to be like prisoned and under the computer and everything yes youre right we have to make a dialogue a discussion between the teacher that will be here to help the children not only to learn them like magistrarly just to discuss with them to increase the autonomy of the children and their capacity to communicate with each other 
01		i dont think that we have to make them use only technology making them use it doesnt mean that they wont be writing or anything beside they dont have to do it all the time 
01		yes we could but i also think that using technology is very important because we are facing a new generation a new world with new ways to learn and i think that we should adapt the school system to this it could increase their autonomy with more dialogue the professor wont be there just to stand here and talk and students wont be passive anymore i think its important for them to learn them to be active more active and to increase their autonomy 
01		yes i think thats interesting and i agree with you they use screens and internet and computers all the time its a generation who was born with this and who knows it may be better than us and i think that we should learn them how to make good things and to use these computers and all these screens usefully we have to learn them how to make it good how to do good things with it how to use them and use them to help them like even in the work at work at school because now the children are using these screens and everything mostly to do not to work to divertissement and everything so i think its important to learn them how to work with it and how to make it useful 
01		yeah i think this is how this is why the teachers are important and this is why they are here and they have to be well trained to involve to the children the value of it that they have a chance to have these i dont know these computers and this technology 
01		and i think that if we learn them how to use them correctly and not only for netflix and everything and playing games and everything i think that it can only be great they will know how to make it great 
01		this is how this why sorry we have to put a lot of financial resources on this project to form correctly the teachers so they actually know what to do and not just do what they usually did on a computer because this is nonsense this is not useful at all we have to form to train the teacher well so they can transmit to the children the right thing what we want them to do 
01		yeah this is how i think we should have a discussion with the state and big associations and everything to have to be allowed to afford it and to offer everyone the same chances to use technology usefully 
01		well i think its something that will take a long time of course we cannot do it in a few years and just its not that fast it cannot be that fast but i think that on the long term we will be able to do this of course it will take a bit of time but this is now we have to start it 
01		of course but it has to be well done and we dont have to discriminate any children we can test on a few classes but as it works when its well done i think we should now start to think about finance this in priority because i think this is the future we have a generation that was born with this technology and we have to adapt with it so maybe i dont know maybe abandon old system progressively to at the end to end up with this technology system being the main one
