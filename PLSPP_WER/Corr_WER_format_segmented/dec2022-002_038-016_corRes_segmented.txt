01		so what do you think about the priority that we can call be in the matter of technology in the classroom do you think its a good thing because i think in my opinion if you including more technology in the classroom we are going to increase the knowledge and the skill of the students its a way to discover a new method what do you think about that 
01		ok and as you say some students doesnt have access at the technology and do you think that if we put in class some computers and work just a little time at every class they can discover new things because they dont have at their home 
01		yes im agree with you its very expensive and teachers need a very good training but i think its a way to increase the curiosity of children and students and it may be a way for them to study in a way more exciting and more interesting for them so i think we need to found a solutions for there is not too much but not not at all what do you think 
01		yes but in the real life when you have a job a work you need to know how use a computer because a lot of job using computers for reading mail do some studies so i think its not good if there is too much but they need a little bit every month or every day for increase their knowledge and skills for their future jobs so which solution can we found together 
01		and maybe it can be a good idea if they do some research in the internet for discover computer and how youre working and maybe some exercise but as you say tests are on the paper with a pen so just a little bit for their curiosity and discover 
01		solution if teacher decided to do three hours of sorry of their courses on the computer of maybe just an hour per day or three hours per month because they need so i understand that they dont need very much but not less 
01		yes i think change the way of the learning not just on the board with exercise paper and books that can attract studies students sorry they can be more excited to learning and more interested on their courses 
01		and as you already said its very expensive so maybe not i dont know a computer for every student but some few some computers in the class and they can turn during three hours and some done exercise on their papers and other on the computers 
01		maybe we cant dont give homework at home on a computer for a varied inequalities as you said but do some exercise in the school 
01		so if i can conclude maybe we can say that we are going to do maid lot of many technology in class three hours per day but with rotations thats going to avoided the inequalities between students and they can increase their knowledge and skills ive missing something 
00		im disagree with you because i think its more harm than good and school should moderate using technology indeed social inequalities can be evocated because some students dont have the tools necessary and dont access to computer or internet for example so i think its not a good way to admiting new technology in classroom 
00		yes its possible but its so expensive for the schools and the teacher must be formed and its a major problem to develop new technologies so expensive for the school and increase inequalities in other hand 
00		yes im agree with you on this point but the risk is to disconnect the people the students with the reality and i think its more better to read a book for example than to learn with a computer and for example in some countries students dont have the possibility to buy good equipment and access of new technology increase social inequalities 
00		yes a little bit is a possibility and the students take pass exam pass assessments and the assessments were written so i think its possible to make 
00		one hour per day its a good solution i think and its a good way to 
00		to increase yes yes capacity and skills in different topics 
00		and each student must be can be access to a computer and also learn with a pen and a paper 
00		i think like i already say that school should moderate using of technology and i think your proposition is very good for the students and the teacher
