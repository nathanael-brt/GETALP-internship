00		id like to say that the use of technology in the classroom is not always good it can bring a lot of harm to students and also to the school as well first of all id like to say its expensive to implement you need to buy the goods like computers and boards and also the equipment that you need to maintain the computers 
00		indeed it could be the role of the state to provide but you have also to take in account the fact that teachers need to be trained which also costs money and time time away from the students who could benefit of a more traditional way of education so where would that money come from 
00		so dont you think that progressively the teacher wont be needed and it could lead to unemployment if their children are able to study without teachers and just using technology maybe one day it will go too far and we will lose the profession that is teaching 
00		in fact this is a good argument but i think that we should also take account in account that technology at school could have a negative impact on the student life as far for the screen time because technology is present everywhere so at home also and if there is no break between use at home and at school it can lead to addiction and problems like anxiety 
00		so what i hear you say is that the traditional way of teaching is still needed therefore it also shows that technology has maybe not its part in a classroom if you still need the balance between traditional teaching and technology so yeah i think technology can be useful but you also have to take account that not everyone has access to it and if maybe we start using it then we have to homework to do with it and researches and some students dont have access to that because of low income and it could 
00		i see but i hear also is that its a really expensive project like i said to buy the computers to keep them to keep the maintenance up everything i dont think every school every that the state has the money for that in every school and moreover when maintenance is needed you cant use the technology so it can also slow down the learning process while its in maintenance while computers or technologic devices are in maintenance they cant be used so it slows down the learning process 
00		what about exams because when you learn to take on a computer or to work on a computer and then you find yourself in front of a sheet and a traditional way of writing exams you students may be lost because they are not that used to it 
00		so i hear you and i feel like we can go to a compromise where we think that technology can be used but with limits and work that in the schools with the teacher who need a lot of training 
01		yeah but i think that is the role of the states the states need to how can i say it need pay for all of it because its his job to permit to all students to have the equipments required for 
01		yes but to my mind the new teachers will bring the new 21st century childrens so they will grow up with the new technology so we will need to teach them less than actually with the old teacher 
01		no because im not saying that robots can replace teachers i just think that the technology sorry is a tools for teachers to help the student or the child to make more research its a tools that they can use for example to go far away from their from what they knows the teacher can not know everything so when for example they work on the project or something they can use the technology to help them to work to reach new methods of working of teaching 
01		yes i agree but that is our work that is the teacher work and parents work we need to control the time that the child spend on the screen for example we can work only two hours a day on screen sorry screens at school and the parents can control the times when the child will come back at home so the child will not spend too much time on the screen and we can do like exercise like who seems like feedback to talk about what did you see on screen what did you think to make to share together with the children to have their feelings about the screen and to check if they are good with it 
01		thats why i think that the state must pay for it because i think the for example the states can buy computers or some advices for the school the school will rent it to the students so they will have all the same computers all the same advices so their will be not like i say disparities i can say it like this disparities between them it will be easier easier sorry for the teacher because they will have all the same computers or advices 
01		the teacher because they will have all the same computers or advices and their will not be disparities because they will work they will be equal 
01		not based on technology its just a tools that they can use to help them not its not the major party of the works so it will not be like something missing when they are in maintenance you understand the teacher will work with their like you said traditional methods but they can use the technology to help them to bring new methods to adapt their methods to students which are maybe different maybe who wants to discover something different because they have a different level for example 
01		in class they used to work mathematics without a computer they should do the exam without the computer but if they works something like a french with the computers they will pass the exam with the computers too like this they will have the habits 
01		exactly like i said the technology will not be the base of the teaching it will be just a plus a tools that can be used by the teacher to help the children
