00		yeah yeah i understand what you said im sure there was a lot of other things we can talk about but i think the main subject of the animal testing is all the benefits we have thanks to we can see all the medicine progress 
00		of things to say about it and it could be a 
00		oh yeah right but it can be an example but there is so much other medication or treatment who worked and the aspirine ones okay they try animal testing and it maybe doesnt work with this one and it was more relevant with other method that like i dont know computer method but this is for the moment the main the most relevant practice to find to progress in any medicine 
00		we dont really have a lot of like how to say we didnt work enough with other method to be sure its a good one and this one i think in my point of view 
00		yes it would be great to talk about it for sure for sure we need to give all the information to everybody and to give a better understood understanding of the subject but this is not the biggest argument you know what i mean they need those information in the 
00		i keep my idea its the animal testing and they could argument about it because yeah we thought we have a lot of other method they work but we also have the you know the three r and i think its a good argument to animal testing iencebecause they took conscience of the painful or the harmful they could inflict to the animal and they work with but they still use the 
00		of view and we can work both together but i think we need to reclarify each point and put like like its a shade of grey and not everything its white or black 
00		yeah yeah i think the two of them is great because if we give only your point of view everybody will be oh god we have to stop animal testing because this is the bad things we just lost money its not relevant and we dont conclude anything because we dont have good result or just any result but thats not true because we have some result and the research on animal testing its for the moment the most the one whos working well because we can study like living cells and the interaction between them and we cant xxx that on computer or anything 
00		yeah i agree and i think its this article can lead to a great information and everybody can have their own opinion 
01		yeah i dont really agree with your point of view because i dont think that we can write an article all about the progress about the animal testing because 
01		but the thing that youre talking about are not very relevant and not always relevant because we have seen a lot of 
01		problems in animal testing like the aspirine one have you heard about 
01		in fact a lot of animal testing experiences were not finished and they lead to nowhere like we dont have the results of them and its a large number of animal testing experience that have no benefits on our society 
01		animal testing is the good and like the only thing but its not true at all there are a lot of alternative methods i know that sometimes alternative method are not enough but in many cases they are enough and we dont use them enough 
01		the three r are like a rule but not everybody follow the rules and i think we have to think twice about the fact that we 
01		we have to think twice about the fact that we are doing like animals belong to us but animals dont belong to us they are just suffering in our laboratory and its not like we are pretending this is a right thing or we are not even thinking about it its not a subject that we talk about we are pretending that its okay 
01		but i dont i think that for many years your point of view have been showed so i think its a right thing to show my point of view also like try the two of them 
01		i heard what you are saying but i think so we can show your point of view but we can also say that its in many situation we can do without animal testing and if we need animal testing maybe we can think to hire less animal less animals and in better conditions and like invest money fo their wellbeing their wellbeing because 
01		yeah i think that its a good opportunity for the researchers because we will write a very interesting article with our both point of view and im glad that we are working together
