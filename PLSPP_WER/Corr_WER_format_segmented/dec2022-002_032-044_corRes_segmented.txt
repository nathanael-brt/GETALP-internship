01		maybe why not yes so our foundation wants to invest in technology for classroom i think its an idea because we are in the 21st century but we have some problems with that and i want to show you why im maybe to moderate the technology using because i think firstly to the potential problem with connection and with this problem we can have some losing time for teachers and im afraid that it could not the best solution for the student 
01		yes but i see two major problems what but i understand your but i think we will have a problem of cost because its very expensive to have people to hire to be here for this informatic problem and you say you want to learn to teacher maybe to solve this problem themselves but its also very expensive to learn to them and i think you spoke about inequality but some low incomes students will have technology in classroom its a good idea i have no problem but you dont think that when they come back at home if they dont have a connection or good technology maybe they will be in a situation of inequality because of that its a question or you can we can invest for help them with 4g key or other way i dont know but its very expensive and 
01		okay so if you think to program and invest on the long time and we can maybe reduce the cost like that im totally agree with this project but i have also another issue that i think is in adequation of this system for different points i think to the example for university and others that are writing writing test and maybe as student who are dyslexic maybe it could be more difficult for them with technology than writing 
01		but so i suggest you to moderate and keep paper and pen and paper methodology even we can introduce technology its not a problem just keep a part of old school 
01		so i think we can go to this big investment for this school but its clear for you and me and i very happy for that that we have to be careful to maintain old school methodology but its very important im agree to continue to invest for our century and for these students 
00		okay i understand your point of view i think the problems can be solved with the experts that we can hire to come help the teachers in class to avoid time loss and we have to make formations for teachers too to avoid the time loss with technical problems and i think we must do all of that because we have to use technology in xxx because it can reduce inequalities between the students that 
00		more affluent and the ones who live in less affluent situations so we have to do all that 
00		yes indeed the problem of money is very big problem to counter that we have to make plans to replace the material and also make updates oftenly that can be considerate in the budget of the foundation so i think thats a problem but it can be we can do with that also yes you said that the students that have less money cant have the internet at home and that can be a issue with their homeworks and yes as you said we can provide them computers or 4g keys because thats very important thats you talked about 20th century skills xxx before thats important that all the students can have those 20th century skills and all the thats important that all of the students can have access to computers and the internet 
00		yes youre totally right for this problem yes as you said we have to keep the pencil and paper based learning because as you said state programs are 
00		traditional and the tests must be with pencil and paper so plus we have to keep this way or learning because the time that spend young people on screens are already high so it must be not too high because it can cause anxiety and the social skills can be compromised so yes we have indeed 
00		the role to limit this time on the screen i agree with you but i think we can 
00		okay so im glad that our students can profite of the technological learning in the future
