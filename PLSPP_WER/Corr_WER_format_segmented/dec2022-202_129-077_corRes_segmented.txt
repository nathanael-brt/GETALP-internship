00		so hello today we are gonna discuss about the we are gonna suggest to our supervisor if we have to put technologies on the classroom of if we dont have to implement this in the classroom so first i think that this is a good thing to implement this type of technology like computers in this class in the classroom in the course and the school in general because i think the first students like it and there is already studies that have showed that there is a higher level of engagement 
00		for example for students who dont like to talk because they are a little scared 
00		i get your point here but i think that even if there is no computer on the classroom there is already a possible student who can play on the phone or something else that already can distract other student behind them but i get your point here and i agree with you 
00		okay i understand but i think that this is not the at risk student who buy these computer i think that school where they are in must buy this computer for them like this is already happening in some area where the state gives free computers to student and student dont have to pay them 
00		want to say that this is a little lost of time and i think that this is a lot of a lost of time in the present but after i think that thanks to these technology and computers students will learn lessons and skills more fast faster so i think that the time will be gained after 
00		okay i go along with you i think that all student and people today are a bit addicted to this type of technology like computers or phone but i think that this is the student or the people at home who have to reduce the time they are using this technology because it is very useful in the school i think 
00		okay okay yes i think that we have to just not use them use the computers and this technology every day at school but i think this is a good idea to add computers in classroom and more it can help for future jobs because now all jobs will be like engineer for artificial intelligence and so we have to have a student who learn this type of skills to have a good jobs in the future 
00		yes i agree we dont have to put children at like five or four years old directly in this type of technology we have to before know the life but yes we have to regulate them like maybe twice a week or maybe just a few class or course so yes 
00		okay so i think that we are finish and i agree with you with the twice a week and i think this is a good idea 
01		hello i share your view but for me i think that new technologies have problems these technologies can distract the students when they are in class 
01		for example if a student play on his computer the other student next to him 
01		yeah its true but another problem of new technology is the cost of this technologies its very expensive to buy a computer and at risk student cant buy a computer expensive and they can have problem to access to network connection when they are at home 
01		a good idea but for me moreover a buy of a computer for at risk student the teacher need to 
01		to have a formation to know how to integrate this technology 
01		yeah i go along with you there but for me its a good thing because a student can learn faster but the major problem is that the students have a sixth or eighth screen look screen by day but if they use screen at school it can increase this time spend on looking screen and it can 
01		yeah its true and for me we need to integrate this technology at school but we need to limit the time spent on the screen 
01		it can gonna be a tool integrate at traditional method 
01		if if we want to use this technology at school we need to regulate them and begin to use this technology not before a certain age like six years 
01		yes twice a week is a good idea because it keep the advantage of this technologies to learn faster
