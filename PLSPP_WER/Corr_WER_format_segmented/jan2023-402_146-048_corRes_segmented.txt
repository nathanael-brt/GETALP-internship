01		i agree with you on the fact that we have no other solution to offer for stop animal testing but i dont think its a good idea to speak for the animal testing but most against animal testing because its if people read our article i think its important to shows to the 
01		in my mind in the future with the evolution of technology it will 
01		to stop animal testing not just reduce but stop because we have we invent today we invent lot of things and i think if we take a little of a our time to think about this problem i think we can find a solution for stop radically animal testing 
01		okay so for this article i think with all of we say that this article should be objective talk about animal testing the argument in favor of animal testing and against animal testing i think its a good way and i think its very important to talk about the new technology the new 
01		that this technique hurt animals and can kill them 
01		i think its not possible to speak about a favour of animal testing 
01		because animals are also conscientious like you and me and in reality i think you dont want to test some drugs some things which could hurt you and kill you 
01		yes but okay if you want theyre animals are not conscientious but its a part of our world of our biodiversity of our environment and its very 
01		good way so i think there are other solution to test medical to make test medical tests scientific test so 
01		new technology and other way but new technology we are in the xxx society which 
01		which are in increase and in developing and all day we have new technology and new things to increase the world so we can find a solution to stop animal testing 
01		i agree because the technology is not in not with the technology its not possible today to stop animal testing but in our article i think its important to say that 
01		we have they have a lot of research on technology to stop animal testing and we dont agree we disagree sorry we disagree with the fact of animal testing but 
00		ah yeah so you want to speaks in an objective way or you want to give some arguments in disfavour of animal testing 
00		human life is better and more important that than an animal life and thats why we dont test on a child or on a person who have a life who have a conscience animal dont have a conscience just theyll feel pain yes but they dont have a mind and a conscience and a sophisticate mind 
00		in the future if we have the money if we have the knowledge we can create an just things of simulation of the human body but today its so 
00		animals because for me we are even if we have some technologies like simulation like computer 
00		maybe you can reduces this number of animals but not completely stop this kind of project 
00		new humans with machines like artificially so i think its unethical for me we have to
