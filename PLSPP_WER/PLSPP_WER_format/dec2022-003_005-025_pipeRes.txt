00		 so i personally think that new technologies aren't any good in class and it should be something that is out of the school and not in the school 
00		 there are two kind of situations i think when there are everyday new technologies and it can represent a distraction and of course on the other side there can be like once a week a class with computer to learn new technologies to the 
00		 yes but we know of quite a time now that the amount of time that students pass on a device and make a smartphone computer is a great huge amount of time like six to eight hours a day so we do not need to increase this time 
00		 this is a good point money if we want a new technology in class this should be with great equipment like you said not necessarily a computer per student but there will be some investment that we need to do and of course there will be maybe instruction of teacher because not only teacher know how to use keyboard or computer for their course for mathematics for example and so there is a maybe inequality between the school that has the money for this and school that doesn't have 
00		 new stuff i agree with you so if the government say that you will invest in this and of course 
00		 of course give money to school that doesn't have that much money i can even really think that some technology on a certain level with a minimum amount of time can be good because of course this is not all bad 
00		 yes but we have to invest but we need to have money and to make sure that some people like government 
00		 of kind of people will help and will do everything they can so there isn't any inequality between school and between students because this is the future of the country so if some kids doesn't have the same education done over this will increase inequality 
00		 yes of course so maybe if this is on good regulation technology can be slowly slowly integrated in a classroom but with regulation like i said not every day like once a week for example to start or like one hour a day or something like this 
01		 okay i understand your point of view but today the technology is quite important because we need computer to access to websites or things like this and teacher has needs sorry to show things to the class or things like this 
01		 i agree but i think that the foundation priorities should be the development of new way with new technologies to learn and to teach for the kids it's a better way to to learn because they are more happy to be there they enjoy the class and for the teachers it's more simple because they can use a lot of things and diversify how they work 
01		 i know i agree with you but technology is also keyboard or the things i can project an image on the keyboard and it's not just the computer so if we invest in the research of new technology we may discover the new way we do not need to be on a computer or ipad or something like this but who can be a technology and help the teacher 
01		 i know that and actually it doesn't really concern us it's the government who has to help this school and this teacher and also the parents because maybe the child is in a great school yes but he maybe has no money but it's a government who has to help the school and we should offer them the opportunity to buy 
01		 okay but maybe we should just talk about this with the governments for communication and try to see what we can do but i think that even if we don't know what the government was going to say we know that we have to invest on new technology because it's to improve 
01		 this will increase inequality the government will choose to impasse its inhabitants because there is too many years he knows he has to do it because the school needs this for work and work in a good way because we saw that the child and the teacher are more are more rps and the school when there is more technology 
01		 yes i agree with you because we all know that the screen is bad for everyone not just each other not just each other yes and it's useful but we have to as you say so we the the teacher do this part they they have to adapt with the things that we offer to them yes and so we just had to agree with the fact that we invest and
