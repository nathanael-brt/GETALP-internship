00		 i agree with you on the fact that we have no other solution to stop animal testing but i don't think it's a good idea to speak for the animal testing but against animal testing it's if people with our original i think it's important to show to the 
00		 in my mind in the future with the evolution of technology it will 
00		 it's really completely possible to stop animal testing not just reduce but stop today we invent a lot of things and i think if we take a little of a whole time to think about this problem i think we can find a solution for stop radically animal testing 
00		 okay so for this article i think with all of this say that this article should be objective talk about animal testing the argument in favor of animal testing and against animal testing i think it's a good way i think it's very important to tell you about the new technology the new 
00		 that this technology earth animal can kill them 
00		 i think it's not possible to speak about a favour of animal tasting 
00		 because i most are also concerned to use like you and me and in reality i think you don't want to test some drugs some things which cruise a few and kill you 
00		 yes but okay if you want the animals are not conscientious but it's a part of our world of our biodiversity of our environment and it's very
00		 good way so i think there are other solutions to test to make a test to a medical test so it's not a 
00		 new technology and all the way but new technology we are in the 3rd society which 
00		 which are in increase and in developing and all day we are new technology and new things to increase the world so we can find the solution to stop animal testing 
00		 i agree because the technology is not with the technology it's not possible today to stop animal testing but in our article i think it's important to say that 
00		 we have a lot of features on technology to stop animal testing and we don't agree with the fact of animal testing but 
01		 ah yeah so you want to speak in an objective way or you want to give some arguments in the favour of animal tasting 
01		 human life is better and more important than an animal life and that's why we don't test on the child or on the person who have a life or a conscious animal don't have a conscious just they'll feel the pain yes but they don't have a mind and a conscious and a sophisticated mind 
01		 in the future if we have the money if we have the knowledge we can create just things of simulation of the human body but today it's so 
01		 animals because for me we have even if we have some technologies like simulation like computer 
01		 maybe you can reduce this number of animals but not completely stop this kind of project 
01		 new humans with mentioned like artificial me so i think it's political for me we have to
