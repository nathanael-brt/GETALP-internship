00		 i personally think that incorporating technologies in our class could cause more harm than good first because it's very expensive and maybe our school is not able to afford that kind of technologies 
00		 yes but there are some i agree with you but there are some costs that are too expensive to be made for example there are some rural areas that aren't equipped with a very good internet connection and building a good internet connection would cost a lot 
00		 there are a lot of disparities between people who can't afford a computer and people who can't afford a computer and people who have who doesn't have the money for it are not used to use computers so they will be not at the same level as people who already know how to use a computer so they will have to be trained even more 
00		 students will just use the computers as a teaching method and not really interact with their teachers or interact with other students or being on the computer all day long can lead to i don't know a lack of social skills or anxiety or being very dependent on the computer and not on classic teaching methods 
00		 yeah i think probably only use computers only a few hours a day or during certain lessons or we could also just use computers at school and not at home to prevent these experiences 
01		 hello so we need to make some suggestions to know hello we need to make some suggestions of our supplier about the new technology in teaching what do you think about that 
01		 about the cost of the technologies i think personally if we make a good plan so we make a big invest first but we make a good debt plan so we need to remake a big invest later and it can reduce the cost because we don't have to recruit technology experts if troubleshooting appears but yes they are some cost in maintenance etc 
01		 yes but if we make a good internet connection for example we can increase the skill of our students because we can make an evolution of our teaching like a teacher or can give a subject to a student and a student with a good internet connection can make research about the subject and that's really great for the teaching and for the students and can add some interest for the students because some students cannot be interested in teaching paper and pencil 
01		 yes there are some costs to train the teacher or the students but if we train the teacher if we make a big investment of new technology if the students add interest of our teaching and yes there are some disparities but we can help the students with a computer we lead to us or we can increase our skills and now we are in the 21st century and the computer is the skills we need to be to be known because we use all day computer like for typing for presenting on the presentation etc 
01		 yes yes but we can also create book clubs or writing clubs the students can read a book or can try to write and etc and that's good for the assessment but we need also to 
01		 to remake the assessments with computer for example we can make an assessment with computer if we give some computer on students as well as assessments and could be great for us 
01		 so we can make a transition between the paper and pencil and the technology we can make some transition step by step with incorporating technology little by little on our teaching it could be great 
01		 yes as a student can you only use a computer on technology lessons for example or for a mathematical lesson for example that could be a good transition for incomproic technology in your teaching and also make our school modern with some technologies
