00		 so i think that using technology in classrooms provides better help to students and it can be customized to the student's needs so it can be very helpful for them and help them to learn stuff according to their own needs 
00		 yeah i totally understand what you're saying and so that's why we are helping the teachers with teacher coaches to help them better handle all the students in class to help them control everything that is done in the in the better way and also a few software applications that can help the teacher control what the well what all the students are doing in time so i honestly think that towards students that are often not very paying attention to class actually technology can help them to engage in the lesson way more because it can provide them other ways to communicate with their students around them 
00		 of course it's a really long-term investment because it's a lot of money and it's a lot of people that are going to be involved if we need to hire more teachers and stuff it can be very helpful and on the long term it can help so much students to find better jobs for themselves especially when we are in a constantly evolving society and we are actually helping our students to 
00		 train for jobs that are going to be different from what we have now and so i think it's so important that we have to make this investment 
00		 can be a problem okay i totally understand and that's a real issue that it needs to be worked on because when we take such big measures to change a system that's been working the same way for a long time we need to be aware of all the consequences that it can bring and of course cyber bullying and anxiety caused from being way too much on screens is an issue and we are aware of it so we actually make programs to help the parents and the students to control themselves and to have a better handling of what happens on the screens and of course it's an issue that we have to consider and in order to put this in place but i think that it really can help students to understand what society needs of them right now and what their future jobs need to be i just think that it has a lot of good impacts but of course we need to understand that the consequences can be harmful and so we need to control this in order to prevent it 
00		 okay so what you mean i think is that we should like have a time where they are using technology and sometimes when they aren't so they can have also the standard standard way of learning and also because all the exams that they have to pass the official exams are still in the same format as before with a paper and a pen so they need also these standard skills to understand and to have a good 
00		 okay so we should maybe split the time where some time they have pen papers and books and they can learn from that and sometimes when they use technology and they learn to use it in so they learn to use it in same way in a not harmful way and in a controlled way from the teachers and the parents 
00		 we need to have to choose as like people who help the students not that are replaced by computers 
01		 i agree with what you're saying but the problem is that you can control what every student on the class did with the laptop so it could create a distraction for some of them and if some are not really good to pay attention to what the teacher says it could also provide a lot of distraction to them and they will not be really helped with that system 
01		 provide more harm to them than it could be good because they may not be as attentive as if it was just the teacher we became 
01		 i see what you mean that you tell that you need to train the professors to use these new technologies and as a lot of 
01		 teachers who are now in this color system may not be born with the technology so they need to learn more about how to control it how to use it et cetera and it could cost very much because you need to install a lot of computers to help every pupil because if you want to put this system to help every student everyone should be at the same level so everyone should have a home computer provided by the school if it's possible and then it would be a so much expensive measure and then you need to hire a person to form the teachers how to use it and i think it could be so expensive for schools who don't have a lot of money from the system 
01		 but in which research do you think this investment would be great because in my opinion yes the society evolves and we need to teach our students how to use the things which are on their positions now it might be also important to preserve their health because we know that computers could have and the using of internet could have a lot of wrong consequences on the on the health not like on the on the up seasheck aspect it could cause anxiety depression and a low self estimate because 
01		 there could be harassment too on internet or not so at school but it could create this and inequalities and some people could make fun of others is they are not at the same level and i think it 
01		 yeah i think it's important to prevent it and it may be great to limit the using of these tools because i completely understand and completely agree with you on the fact that it's important to teach the student how to teach them something that could be really helpful for them in their future but to preserve them i think it could be great to limit the using of computers or of internet because we know that at home they use video games television smartphones the tablets etc and i think the school is the moment where they can disconnect from this and it could be it could be interesting for them to have the knowledge and the skills with the technology but i think it could be a reasonable 
01		 the system doesn't change completely so we need to still form them and train them to what they are going to have as an exam and we cannot i think in my opinion 
01		 impose them to use computers every day and in every single class because it could not be great at the end because they will not even know how to write it they are typing on their keyboards every time and so yeah it could be important to limit this and to maintain a more traditional way of learning 
01		 it's exactly what i would like to see in our schools nowadays because they need these knowledges and we can bring them to them but it it's needed that it's in a controlled way because it could be so harmful for them and for the teachers because if the teachers doesn't know how to do it it will not help them if they just put the time with the computer and don't really know how to organize their own lessons
