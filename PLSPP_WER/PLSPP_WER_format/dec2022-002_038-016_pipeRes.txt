00		 so what do you think about the purative that we can be in the matter of technology in the classroom do you think it's a good thing because i think in my opinion if you including more technology in the classroom we are going to increase the knowledge and the scale of the students it's a way to discover a new method what do you think about that i don't know hi 
00		 okay and as you say some students don't have access at the technology and do you think that if we put in class some computers and work just a little time at every class they can discover a new thing because they don't have access at their home 
00		 yes i'm a great review it's very expensive and teachers need a very good training but i think it's a way to increase the curiosity of children and the children and it may be a way for them to study in a way more exciting and more interesting for them so i think we need to fund solutions for there is not too much but not at all what do you think 
00		 yes but in the real life when you have a job or work you need to know or use a computer because a lot of jobs are using computers for grading mail do some studies so i think it's not good if there is too much but they need a little bit every month or every day for increased their knowledge and skills for their future jobs so which solution can we found together 
00		 yes and maybe it can be a good idea if they do some research in the internet for a discovery computer and how you are working and maybe some exercise but as you say tests are under paper with pen so just a little bit for their curiosity and discovery 
00		 a better solution if teacher decided to do three hours of their courses on the computer of maybe just an hour per day or three hour per month because they need so i understand that they don't need very much but not less 
00		 yes i think change the way of the learning not just on the board with exercise paper and books that can attract students students sorry they can be more exciting to learning and more interesting on their courses 
00		 and as you already said it's very expensive so maybe not i don't know a computer for every student but some few some computers in the class and they can turn during three hours and some don't exercise on their papers and others on their computers maybe 
00		 maybe we can't don't give homework atom on computer for a variety of inequalities as you said but do some exercise in the school class 
00		 okay if i can conclude maybe we can say that we are going to do made a lot of many technology in class three hours per day but with rotations that's going to avoid the inequalities between students and they can increase their knowledge and skills i'm missing something 
01		 i'm disagree with you because i think it's more calm than good and schools should moderate using technology and the social inequalities can be located because some students don't have the tools necessary and don't access to computer or internet for example so i think it's not a good way to admit new technology in the classroom 
01		 yes it's possible but it's so expensive for the schools and the teacher must be formed and it's a major problem to develop new technologies so it's expensive for the school and increase inequalities on the other hand 
01		 yes i'm agree with you at this point but the risk is to disconnect the students with the reality and i think it's more better to read a book for example done to learn with a computer and for example in some countries students don't have the possibility to buy good equipment and access of new technology increase social inequalities 
01		 yes little bit is a possibility and students take exam assessment and the assessments were written so i think it's possible to make 
01		 yes always one hour per day it's a good solution i think and it's a good way to 
01		 to increase capacity and skills in different topics 
01		 and each student can be access to a computer and also learn with a pen and paper 
01		 i think like i already say that school should moderate using of technology and i think your proposition is very good for the students and the teacher
