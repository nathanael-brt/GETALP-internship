00		 i agree with you to keep using books papers and traditional way of learning but in my opinion technology provides extensive opportunities for students it's a way for them to develop new skills and their creativity via using devices like tablets computers etc and it's a new way of learning for them it can develop their interest for what we 
00		 we are studying and like you said they already use electronical devices so developing learning by technology is really in our area and that's why i think we should develop that point in the school 
00		 yes i agree we should limit the use of technology in school like two hours per day maybe that could be interesting to experiment that way of learning 
00		 yes i totally agree with you i think it could be necessary to learn to parents and students the dangers of internet the extreme use of electrical devices on the eyes on concentration etc 
00		 yes or another solution is to ask parents if they have electronic devices at home and for the students who don't have electronic devices to do homework maybe school can provide them a computer to do their homework for example if they have to do expose that could be a solution for them to work at home with technology 
00		 what time do you think we should impose to use technology at school 
00		 okay and in what in what class do you think we should use it for example plastic art mathematics english okay 
00		 okay i agree i think we should put in place two hours per day for these glasses 
01		 i think technology is the future but she has many many problems because the students are already exposed to this technology out of the school so that's why i think we should moderate that use and maybe we can okay 
01		 put a plage of 
01		 of hours still for example one hour for the day and after we continue the traditional way exercise like papers and books and 
01		 yes but what do you think about the psychology of our students if we expose too much our students to the technology we know that it's a possibility for them to develop anxiety and i think that can degrade their relationships so i think we have to take this in consideration and maybe don't 
01		 what do you think about a class of sensitization we could make a place of sensitization for parents and for students to show us the danger of the technology and maybe debate of the benefits and 
01		 there is another thing we are not really agree for the technology using in school i hope the technology will not 
01		 use for the on-work because there is disparity social and i think that some students are not the capacity or the matter is a way to have a computer that they're on so i think it's important to let the technology in the school 
01		 you said two hours per day i agree with that solution because i think two hours is not too much one hour is not enough but two hours you have the time to make many things and i think it's enough 
01		 i think we can use it for mathematics french lesson just for grammar exercise when it's about reduction i prefer paper of course but for just simple exercise computer technology is a great way and the mathematics of course physical one is possible svt you can use the technology
