01		 i personally think that have technology in classes it's a new perspective of teaching and it enables students to be curious and search information online on topics they like and also ecologically speaking it's a good environment because we don't have to use paper so i think it's quite good 
01		 i'm listening to your point but i think it has this topic of technology in classes as pros and cons and you're telling the cons that is harassment but i think that things could be could be put to avoid harassment i don't have a solution 
01		 i have mixed feelings about that because i think that technology can allow children or students and teachers to have a dialogue another dialogue from the classic school and i think also that now with the development of data it's more practical to search online things than in books 
01		 also a square is a good thing for the level of the side i don't know it's allowed to do a certain how do we say it 
01		 you can follow the line i think it's great to have technology in school and at home because for children it's 
01		 and for teachers it's a news perspective to teach and it's interesting for them 
01		 yes the fact is that teachers in their childhood in the last decade weren't ability to use technology because it didn't exist but the thing is that they can now be coached and they can in turn learn to learn to check out how to proceed 
01		 i totally agree with you and i think one or two hours per day or per week it's a good thing 
02		 okay i'm gonna defend the fact that the school should moderate the use of the technology in the classroom because there's a lot of negative point about it like it's not good things to be in-screen all day for a child because it can develop an anxiety and the child can become an anger more easily and they are not very concentrate when they are on a screen no one can really watch what they are doing in front of the screen so it can develop civil harassment so it's why it should be moderate 
02		 well what about the moderation of the use because of the sub-assments that can be made of 
02		 i don't have a solution i see what you're taking but don't you think that people must not be very concentrate when they're not in front of the screen you know what i mean when the teacher is speaking in a traditional way that you will think okay let's not be concentrate now and be concentrate on the screen because it's done and it's 
02		 what about the anxiety the anger and all the negative point that the studies show the screen don't you think that a low children at home is usually on the screen come to class and also a screen is a good thing for the development of the side or not
02		 one we don't really use the teacher the old teacher we don't really use the screen or everything and when you ask them to teach with the things that they didn't know how to use it 
02		 compromise yes between everything yeah i listen what you are saying and i think that the the screen is a good thing but it should be motivated yes i'm not i'm not it's not a no for me to be used at school but it should be motivated because of everything that is a consequence of the using of the school yes i'm totally 
02		 yeah and not normal yes the traditional way should be used yes and not only on the screen yeah both are
