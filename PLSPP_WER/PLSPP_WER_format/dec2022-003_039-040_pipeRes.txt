00		 yes but don't do the thing that children only use technology at school it isn't too much and they have to continue to write with their hands and don't only use the new technology 
00		 because i think that they have to continue writing and writing because the jobs that use the right will continue so i think it will be great to moderate between new technology and like whole school 
00		 okay so it's going to be a transition yeah yeah so maybe what we can do is for a certain class trying to use it 
00		 yeah to test and if it's beneficial or not maybe we will introduce it for the new generations 
00		 and if it doesn't work for the new generations is it not depends that we could gravitate and 
00		 for example use this money that we used for children who doesn't have the chance to learn like in some certain poor country rather than use it for our school that we have 
00		 there is a connection problem in a class that the teacher cannot make his class for example there is a risk that you don't have with a traditional way of learning 
00		 yeah but i still think it's not a good idea because you lose the to have the discussion with the teacher you don't have the you will lose all the euro 
00		 your abilities to go and have a discussion with another people except behind the computer when you're going to work your professional life you will have to to discuss with for example a client if you go in commercial way so i think you have to to use technology because yeah i agree it's important for our generation so 
00		 yeah but there is a problem that scientists prove that and like therapists prove that use technology at school even children use technology out from school so they use at school out from school and it develops anxiety for example and it can develop depression if they don't have access to the technology so i think they get we have to 
00		 make a balance between school and not school so we can make different classes for example like if the parents want because this is their choice when children are young and make different classes 
00		 yeah but i don't think that for little parts yes they will use it correctly but most of the children will 
00		 want to go on netflix on youtube and it's going to be a distraction more than a real surprise 
00		 make the transition and use technology and if the teacher doesn't want to use it he will not use it correctly and i think it's just a transition of what he knows before and just with technology so it's not necessary useful 
00		 but who is going to pay for all this equipment the school are the parents because it represents huge defense so not everyone can do it for all their children it represents a big difficulty 
00		 beats i think it's not possible in christ if there is a war like actually in ukraine there is a repercussion in every country if we in france we want to do this to put the technology at school the state cannot finance for 
00		 so you have to go back and use the old technical so i think it's not certain you cannot for the moment use it because it's too expensive teachers are still old maybe next generations because they were born with this maybe they will use it correctly but i think for the moment it's not possible 
01		 so i think that we should introduce technology to the classrooms and to the students i think it would be great since we live now in a world where technology is everywhere i think our students are going to have to experience some jobs that we don't know yet that even probably doesn't don't exist yet so i think that we really have to make them familiar with technology with computers with using them in their daily life so what do you think 
01		 i don't think that we have to make them use only technology making them use it doesn't mean that they won't be writing or anything beside they don't have to do it all the time 
01		 i think we're speaking of our country and that right now in our country mostly pretty much everyone has the chance to go to school and to learn so this is now we have to try new things maybe to help the poorest people so they can have it later of course it's going to be difficult but we can't know if we just spend money on something that won't work if we don't try we cannot know if it's going to work or not if we don't try 
01		 yes it can happen of course i think this is why we should put some experts on every school that could be able to make any intervention at any moment to solve the problem if it exists this is why i told you it has to be well organized if it's done if we don't put enough energy in it it won't work this is why we have to put a lot of money right now so it works well and then we're gonna maybe be able to have this technology system that will work and it's gonna be beneficial for everyone 
01		 yeah i agree we have to keep nourishing the relationship between people we don't have to be like imprisoned under the computer yes you're right we have to make a dialogue a discussion between the teacher that will be here to help the children not only to learn them like much as truly just to discuss with them yeah to increase the autonomy of the children and their capacity to communicate with each other 
01		 yes we could but i also think that using technology is very important because we are facing a new generation a new world with new ways to learn and i think that we should adapt the school system to this it could increase their autonomy with more dialogue the professor won't be there just to stand here and talk and the students won't be passive anymore i think it's important for them to learn them to be active more active and to increase their autonomy 
01		 yes i think that's interesting and i agree with you they use screens and internet and computers all the time it's a generation who was born with this and who knows it may be better than us and i think that we should learn them how to make good things and to use these computers and all these screens usefully we have to learn them how to make it how to make it good how to do good things with it how to use them and use them to help them like even in the work at work at school because now the children are using these screens and everything mostly to do not to work to do advertisement and everything so i think it's important to learn them how to work with it and how to make it useful 
01		 yeah i think this is why the teachers are important and this is why they are here and they have to be well trained to involve to the children the value of it that they have a chance to have these computers and this technology 
01		 and i think that if we learn them how to use them correctly and not only for netflix and everything and playing games and everything i think that it can only be great 
01		 this is how this is why sorry we have to put a lot of financial resources on this project to form correctly the teachers so they actually know what to do and not just do what they usually did on a computer because this is nonsense this is not useful at all we have to form to train the teacher well so they can transmit to the children the right thing what we want them to do 
01		 yeah this is how i think we should have a discussion with the state and big associations and everything to be allowed to afford it and to offer everyone the same changes to use technology use for it 
01		 well i think it's something that will take a long time of course we cannot do it in a few years it's not that fast it cannot be that fast but i think that on the long term we will be able to do this of course it will take a bit of time but this is now we have to start it 
01		 of course but it has to be well done and we don't have to discriminate any children we can test all the few classes but as it works when it's well done i think we should now start to think about finance this in priority because i think this is the future we have a generation that was born with this technology and we have to adapt with it so maybe i don't know maybe abandon old system progressively to end up with this technology system being the main one
