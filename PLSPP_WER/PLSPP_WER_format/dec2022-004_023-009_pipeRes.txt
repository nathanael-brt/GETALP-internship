00		 so we are here to defend our position on the foundation which here that could be a matter of technology in the classroom for me i think that technology in school could harm more than be good for students for me schools should be moderate their utilization of new technology 
00		 okay i understand your point of view but for me i think that it could improve their capacities but it also could distract them while they're in class and they just look at the screen and for me and for trapeists also students and younger people are already too much in front of a screen heard before that they are six or eight hours per day in front of the screen and if new technologies are allowed in school we couldn't reduce this screen time 
00		 do you think that technologies can interest students more than if they are just with a pen 
00		 i couldn't agree more with you in this point i think we can have a compromise with this for me i think that a little time of screen in school couldn't have bad effect on the students because they have to live with their time but i think school should moderate their use 
00		 okay yeah i agree with you on this and for you what is the perfect time in the day for a student 
00		 i agree with you with that i also think that if there are more than one or two hours per day in front of a screen like a therapist i encourage this student i have an addiction to technologies and there is a screen on the phone 
00		 i agree with you on this and to talk about another point what do you think technology could do between a student who don't have a lot of money and not have access to technologies and the student who or would you either have a phone a computer or 
00		 okay yeah i understand what you just said so to sum up we agreed that one hour of technology and screen per day in school it's okay it's not too much yes it's a good condition for 
01		 okay so in my opinion the technology in school is not harm but is like an experience and a thing to improve the the learn of the students and the 
01		 i think the students are enjoying the learn and they can be more i don't know but 
01		 yes it's a good condition for students i think and to conclude yes technology is great disparities but it also creates a good moment for students and they can just enjoy to stand up for in school and that's my point 
01		 yes it's like they are in her house and it's more familiar for him to take technologies and to simply run 
01		 yes they need to restrict the time of the student in the screen because i think the students can be more able to deal with if they have a good situation to a good situation to use it somewhere 
01		 for me i think that's half an hour for a day it's a good time for students because extended this time the students were not concentrated in the school 
01		 yes my meanwhile the school some students have an addiction with the screen and the school 
01		 didn't and so i and the school have a goal and this goal is to learn and i think that's the learning can be passed with with the screen of technology but it's not the only goal of school it's not the school of technology it's the school of so it's school to learn not to disrespect 
01		 i think it's great disparities between a school of other technology who have technology and these disparities need to be 
01		 i think because if we create disparities we need to involve the fact that we can have people with our nodes technology and it's simply to to school to 
01		 to create an environment for enjoy technology and school and not just for show us the disparity between this person or this person who have technology and who haven't
