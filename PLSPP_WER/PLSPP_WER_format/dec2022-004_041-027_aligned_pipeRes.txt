00		 so in my opinion it's necessary to develop the technology in high school and in every high school because is that allowed to improve the knowledge of the students and it's a good point for their future job and and in studies in university or something like that 
00		 but i think it's important to to to block this gap between the different high school because i'm a great review everybody can have access to technology a student from a poor high school or a very good high school there is no difference for me everybody has the right to access all the technology and it's necessary for me 
00		 yes but for that i think the state can make a decision to put the budget allowed all the students in high school to have a good tool technology like computer a good system an informatic system etc 
00		 but maybe we can help this whole teacher with give them information and 
00		 some teachers specialized in informatic and new technology can help them to be formed from that new form of a scholarship 
00		 maybe it's difficult to spend a lot of time to be formed with this new technology but it's dramatic because i think it's good for students because they can help them to develop their abilities to resolve problems and to improve their knowledge about this type of technology 
00		 it needs to be framed maybe because there is a good point and a bad point we can not just drop this form of a new system just like that we need to inform everybody students teachers everybody 
00		 we've developed this new system we can begin with one for example one hour per day with a computer and new technology but keep going with the altered method with paper and pen because technology i've also heard limits because in my opinion it's more easy to learn listen with a paper or without a screen 
01		 okay but i understand what you say but i think that it's not possible in all schools because there are some schools who don't have 
01		 if students didn't have a computer their own computer how can they do their homework for example 
01		 okay it's a good idea but this is not only a problem there is also 
01		 yes but new technology is not easy and they need really a lot of time to really understand how it works and it's not really we don't have a lot of time to teach them how to use it 
01		 yes but this shows too that students who use new technology in school develop anxiety 
01		 to my opinion we need to reduce the time the students spend on computers television on just sorry to reduce this time because they spend too much time on this at home and if they are on computer at school too there will be too much time for them and i think it's a problem they need to return at a paper and pen to write to read too 
01		 to add a little of new technology on class maybe one or two hours per day but we can keep also a traditional way to teach
