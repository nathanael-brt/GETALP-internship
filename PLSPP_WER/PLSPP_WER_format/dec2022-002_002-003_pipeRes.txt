00		 okay nice to meet you we are talking today about the technology in the classroom what do you think about 
00		 okay i have absolutely any problem with the fact that students can learn with technologies but there's i think some aspects which are dangerous such as bullying and for that i think that we need to put in place a kind of system of control of the informative tools and it has to be uh uncatuated by the teachers when students are using it what do you think about 
00		 i think that they should also verify the history of the computers or all the devices which were used by the students it has to be moderated i think that they don't have to stay all day behind a screen it has to be only used in a for example for homework for researchers something like that and absolutely in any case for personal users 
00		 but we can also make a kind of open space or co-working space in the school and where there will be some technological devices which can be used every time of the day and could pay me to the students to work as they want with some teachers around who could look at what they are doing if it's in a link or not with the school and maybe put in place a system of card that they had to insert in a kind of box which will verify if they have already used in the day a computer and making some as you say the filters and reducing the time of use per day for example to maximum one hour 
00		 yeah and also there's not only computers or or screens there's also the book club in which i think can continue to learn and to check all the information that they need them for their works and also i was thinking about 
00		 about the sensitization of the students but also the teachers of the schools about the impact psychologically and also physically for example the eye and the health and i think that this system of co-working space with some informatic devices will permit to avoid the social and economical fracture that there is between them 
00		 as it was said in an article between the white colors and the black colors due to their origins and their lifestyle because many people who are of a black skin color don't have informatic devices for work 
00		 yeah so i absolutely agree with all that you said i think that the thing that we have to put in place is to moderate and control the behavior of the citizens and moderate in function of the age of the citizens for example the first growing students have to to use in the maximum health hour per day the computers and the last year's students for example maximum two hours to prepare their exams i don't know what to think about 
01		 well i'm proud technology could say i believe we should implement technology more in the classroom but of course implement your regulations to make sure that the students learn from technology but not with it and to make sure that the art school experience is the best 
01		 well yeah building is one of the risks that is really evident with social media and the fact that students are using it more and more and that their parents are having problems regulating it because they don't really understand the principle so that is why we can also try and implement strict rules regarding the devices like an example was given of the fact that some teachers at the beginning of their classes used to ask questions to students and it would be easier for students to answer forums online and to make sure that those forums are only part of the school website for example and not used by everyone and of course strict regulation regarding may be curse words and make sure that there are filters etc 
01		 yeah i remember a teacher a sixth grade teacher if i remember of the official middle school in the uk that said in her classes she used around one hour of her time for the students to go online to use the screens etc a little bit surprising don't found it don't find it find that because i think it's a little bit too much we should implement rules regarding the hours make sure they don't spend too much time and that the screens they are on doesn't replace it 
01		 yeah that's a really interesting idea john it's a good idea because it's still a combination of normal traditional ways of learning and also screens like some said a teacher said that she used kagan structures which is a form of cooperative learning mode and also because they had little book clubs etc so they would use computers and tablets to learn a little bit more but they also had things outside of screens by interacting with others and learning at the same time 
01		 well yeah currently technology is a bit of a work in progress like you said technology has a real tool on mental health with anxiety low self-esteem sometimes depression and yeah some are more and more advantageous because their parents for example have high incomes compared to others that don't really have access to computers because their parents can't afford to so like i said before try and regulate it and also help by funding schools so that each student can be able to access computers in school and i think we should do that also because we have a lot of learning to do but also learning techniques are already present with technology like this topic of constructivism and inquiry based learning for example where students are taught to search for topics in themselves and teachers are there to guide them you can help with independence constructing a train of thoughts answering questions and understanding instructions 
01		 well i think we can both agree that the foundation's main priority is to ensure that technology is available to everyone but also that there are strict rules to make sure that it doesn't end badly for the students themselves
