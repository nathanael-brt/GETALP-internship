00		 yeah yeah i understand what you said i'm sure there was a lot of other things we can talk about but i think the main subject of the animal testing is all the benefits we had thanks to we can see all the medicine problems 
00		 of the new present medication and i think there is a lot of things to say about it and it could be good english 
00		 oh yeah right but it can be an example but there is so much other medication of treatment worked and the aspirin joints okay they tried animal testing and it maybe doesn't work with this one and it was more relevant with other people like i don't know computer needed but this is for the moment the main the most relevant is too fine to progress in any medicine 
00		 we didn't work enough with the other method to be sure to take good one and this one i think this one could be great for our article and we maybe have much to do 
00		 yes it would be great to talk about it for sure for sure we need to give all the information to everybody and to give a better understanding of this today but this is not the biggest argument you know what i mean they need the information in the 
00		 i keep my idea that i'm noticing and they put an argument about it because yeah we thought we have a lot of other methods they work but we also have the you know the three are you know and i think it's a good and more interesting because they change concerns of the painful to the animal and they work with but they still use the animal testing so it's maybe good compromise between them 
00		 of you and we can work both together but i think we need to really clarify each point and put like and it's a shade of gray and not everything it's white or black 
00		 yeah yeah i think better than it's quite difficult if we give only you kind of you everybody will be oh probably we have to have any more testing because this is the bad things we just lost money it's not relevant and we don't conclude anything because we don't have good results or just any results but that's not true because we have some results and we charge animal testing it's for the moment the most the one who's working well because we can study like living cells and the interaction between them and we can see that on the computer or anything 
00		 yeah i agree i think this article can lead to a great information and everybody can have their own opinion with others 
01		 yeah i don't really read your point on you because i don't think that we can write an article all about the progress about the animal this thing because 
01		 but the thing that you're talking about i'm not really relevant and not always relevant because we have seen a lot of 
01		 problems in annual testing like so as human one have you heard about 
01		 in fact a lot of interesting experiences were not finished and they lead to nowhere we don't have results of them and it's a large number of interesting experiences that have no benefits on our society 
01		 another thing is the good and like the only thing but it's not true at all there are a lot of alternative methods i know that sometimes alternative methods are not enough but in many cases there are enough and we don't use them enough 
01		 the three are like a rule but not everybody follows the rules and i think we have to think twice about the fact that we 
01		 we are doing like animals belong to us but animals don't belong to us they are just suffering in our laboratory and it's not like we are pretending this is a right thing or we are not even thinking about it not a subject that we talk about we are pretending that it's okay 
01		 i don't i think that for many years you point of view have been showed so i think it's a great thing to show my point of view yeah but if we answer like the two of them 
01		 i have what you are saying but i think we can show you point of view but we can also say that it's in many situations we can do without animal testing and if we need animal testing maybe we can seem to hire less animals less animals in better conditions like in this motif where they are well-being because 
01		 yeah i think that it's a good opportunity for the research because we were quite a very interesting article with our both point of view and i'm glad that we are working together
