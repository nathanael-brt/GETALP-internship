00		 i'd like to say that the use of technology in the classroom is not always good it can bring a lot of harm to students and also to the school as well first of all i'd like to say it's expensive to implement you need to buy the goods like computers and boards and also the equipment that you need to maintain the computers 
00		 indeed it could be the role of the stage to provide but you have also taken account the fact that teachers need to be trained which also costs money and time away from the students who could benefit of a more traditional way of education so where would that money come from 
00		 so don't you think that progressively the teacher won't be needed and it could lead to unemployment if their children are able to study without teachers and just using technology maybe one day it will go too far and we will lose the profession that is teaching 
00		 in fact this is a good argument but i think that we should also take account in account that technology at school could have a negative impact on the student life as far for the screen time care technology is present everywhere so at home also and if there is no break between news at home and at school it can lead to addiction and problems like anxiety 
00		 so what i hear you say is that the traditional way of teaching is still needed therefore it also shows that technology has maybe not its part in the classroom if you still need the balance between traditional teaching and technology so yeah i think technology can be useful but you also have to take account that not everyone has access to it and if maybe we start using it then we have to homework to do with it and researchers and some students don't have access to that because of low income that is advantageous 
00		 i see but what i hear also is that it's a very expensive project like i said to buy the computers to keep the maintenance up everything i don't think every school that the state has the money for that in every school moreover when maintenance is needed you can't use the technology so you can also slow down the learning process while it's in maintenance could you repeat sorry while computers or technology devices are in maintenance they can't be used so it slows down the learning process 
00		 what about exams because when you learn to work on a computer and then you find yourself in front of a sheet and a traditional way of writing exams students may be lost because they are not that used to it 
00		 so i hear you and i feel like we can go to a conference where we think that technology can be used but with limits and work that in the schools with the teacher who need a lot of training 
01		 yeah but i think that is the role of the states the states need to pay for all of it because it's his job to provide to all students to have equipment required for 
01		 yes but to my mind the new situation will bring the new 21th century children so they will grow up with the new technology so we will need to teach them less than actually with the old situation 
01		 no because i'm not saying that robots can replace teachers i just think that the technology is a tool for teachers to help the students or the child to make more research it's a tool that they can use for example to go far away from what they know the teacher cannot know everything so when for example the works on the project are something they can use the technology to help them to work to reach new methods of working of teaching 
01		 yes i agree but that is our work that is the teacher work and parents work we need to control the time that the child spends on the screen for example we can work only two hours a day on screen sorry at school and the parents can control the times when the child will come back at home so the child will not spend too much time on the screen and we can do like exercise like we seems like feedback to talk about what did you see on screen what did you think to share together with the children to have their feelings about the screen and to check if they are good with it 
01		 that is his advantage too that's why i think that the state must pay for it because i think for example the states can buy computers or some advices for the school the school will rent it to the students so they will have all the same computers all the same advices so they will be not like i say disparities i can say it like this disparities between them it will be as your teacher sorry for the teacher because they will have all the same 
01		 the same computers are overseas and they will not speak as parities because they will work they will be equal 
01		 not because to my mind the learning process is not based on technology it's just the tools that they can use to help them it's not the majority of the works so it will not be like something missing when they are in maintenance understand the teacher will work with their like you said their traditional methods but they can use the technology to help them to bring new methods to adapt their methods to students which are maybe different maybe who wants to discover something different because they have a different level for example 
01		 in my mind it depends on the skills for example if in class they used to work mathematics without a computer they should do the exam without the computer but if they work something like french with the computers they will pass the exam with the computers like this they will have the habits 
01		 exactly like i said the technology will not be the base of the teaching it will be just a plus a tool that can be used by the teacher to help the children
