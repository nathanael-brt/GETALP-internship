00		 okay so we should write a magical about animal testing yes what do you think about it what the endology 
00		 okay so we worked our article about the tree and you do your research about the speedy tree 
00		 wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
00		 prevent because i disagree i think we should write this article in favor of animal tasting because this method allows breakthrough in silence and research for scientific and to understanding the human body and human disease and everything so for me animal testing is the right method to allow the humanity to have a better life with understanding this function 
00		 but we can do that harmonize our science and using animals like in a better way than before 
00		 no we don't have the radiation to kill like for example we can use animals and testing animals for some subjects but not for the cosmetic testing animals it's a shame it's an nonsense because we have alternatives but like for example human disease sometimes we don't have the correct alternative like for example no it's false it's the same as the case of alzheimer's in the past 
00		 cure mice who are the singers but we cannot translate it for now as do you ma because we didn't understand the molecular basis but to take alternative we can use for example computer alternative but to use it we have to understand the molecular basis so if we don't have the molecular analysis we cannot use alternative before you have to find the alternative by animal testing and what do you think 
00		 what money we are the subventions because we are legally we have legally the obligation to do animal testing it's right in the lobby to create a replacement 
00		 yes but like i said it's not about efficiency and increase the development it's about reality and 
00		 reality and point of the world it's like if you don't understand the buzzes yes you cannot really know the buzzes no we don't know the buzzes we know the buzzes so how what is the basis of azayimir oh so many 
00		 so we have to find it maybe you're right and maybe we can take the point of view of the middle like the trails 
00		 we have to find a challenge but we can't skip the animal testing 
01		 i think the clear pose is really about the animal tasting i just think this is an archive method completely outdated and we have to just think about how we can do this experience without animal testing because that's just wasting money for nothing because any solution could replace this animal testing 
01		 between us human that we are just exploiting the rest of nature it's just outdated it was in the in the 20th century okay it was great and we understand the function of 
01		 but we are okay to say that years to skip the animal testing is two 
01		 okay okay may i correct you just in one point yeah maybe in the past it was a very great solution it was completely great to understand as you say the function of our belief understand how our physical constriction struck but today we have to think ethically and we are humanized how science 
01		 we are not waiting to kill any day 
01		 what do you think about it to create processes of experimentation in vitro by example in the center and in the second time we can effectively create a program in computer modelization which are very very very performance more in another lot of time more performance that's animal testing where computer modelization are more efficient in a lot of time but it's not a question we could 
01		 okay it was the past we did animal testing and we know the function of our body and the body and cellular that create disease et cetera okay but now it's time to transit to a way of science which are more human and when we didn't talk about money 
01		 yes but a lot of there is more supervision as you say to have when we are in the program in the rs program in the rs program or with the legacy in the tree area so if we are coming in the rs program we have more subventions and that could be a transition step between between the experiments with animals and without animals but i just want to say one thing one fact billions of dollar that have been invested in experiments animal testing and just did not succeed we didn't translate the medicaid for human that we test on animals this is very good put all this money on computer modelization which will increase more and more the performance of computer modelization 
01		 oh so i'm not saying scientific lessons or grades so we don't have the magic 
01		 ah i'm okay with the triers but the triers yes maybe maybe an acceleration no no no we can not accelerate it when the triers have been created 15th in the 15th yes but it's 
01		 no we have to create the acceleration of 3r that could be the 3r the speedy 3r okay so 
01		 you need to compromise you're real no no no no you want to skip a genuine testing in the years no no no no no no i want to write entro-polygically
