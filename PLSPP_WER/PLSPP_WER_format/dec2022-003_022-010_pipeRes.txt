00		 in my opinion i think technology is a good idea and it's also an actual subject so it can help her teacher to organize her lesson and also for students it can make the lesson more interesting and more interactive so i think it's a good idea 
00		 yes but maybe we can do a part of technology and also a part of paper and pen so maybe the school can do during the year some exam for training the students to continue to write 
00		 maybe the school can organize a sensitization of students to show the limits of technology maybe they can show that the students can also learn read books and don't usually use technology and also show the limit of time screen for example the nights when the students go to sleep if they have to do them to use the technology where were your screen yes yes thank you 
00		 i think the students that can pay for their computer can buy their own computer and i think the school have to prepare your budget before 
00		 and i don't have a real solution for the money i think maybe for the school working not to 
00		 yes yes i think it's a good idea because the students can participate with this 
01		 in my opinion technology in class is very hard and it's not good we use pen and paper for long decades blackboard books i'm not interested in technology it's successful 
01		 yes you see all the exams and are passed in paper with pen we don't have tablets or computer in the exams 
01		 i see but for the students you talk before you know some studies spoke about its race anxiety and reduce self-esteem we could have issues of adaptivity of students many students use computer technology six to eight hours a day it's enough and we don't have to use it in classrooms 
01		 thank you i see a purpose but the final point i want to talk about is technology very expensive lot of school 
01		 i saw your purpose and why it's interesting i'm ready to act to use interactive whiteboard in the classroom it is very interesting whiteboard 
01		 okay so yeah it's okay we can solve the supervisor to buy some interactive windboard
