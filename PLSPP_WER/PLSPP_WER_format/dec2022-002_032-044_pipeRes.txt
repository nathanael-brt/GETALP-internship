00		 maybe why not yes our foundation wants to invest in technology for a classroom i think it's an idea because we are in the 21st century but we are having some problems with that and i want to show you why i'm maybe to moderate the technology using because i think firstly to the potential problem with the connection and with this problem we can have some losing time for our teacher and i'm afraid that i could not have the best solution for the student 
00		 yes but i see a true major problem but i understand that i think we will have a problem of cost because it's very expensive to have people to hire to be here for this information problem and you say you want to learn to teach maybe to solve this problem themselves but it's also very expensive to learn to them and i think you spoke about inequality but some low-income students will have technology in classrooms it's a good idea i have no problem but you don't think that when they come back at home if they don't have connection or good technology maybe they will be in a situation of inequality because of that it's a question or we can invest for exam for jk or was away i don't know but it's very expensive and this is a problem of money frankly 
00		 okay so if you think to program and invest on the long time and we can maybe reduce the cost like that i totally agree with this project but i have also another issue that i think it's in the equation of the system for different points i think to the example for university and others that are writing tests and maybe as a student who are dyslexic maybe it could be more difficult for them with technology than writing 
00		 but so i suggest you to moderate and chip paper and pen and paper methodology even we can introduce a technology and it's not a problem just to keep a pair of old school 
00		 yes so i think we can go to this big investment for this school but it's clear for you and me and i'm very happy for that that we have to be careful to maintain all school methodology but it's very important i agree to continue to invest further for our century and for the ecosystem student 
01		 okay i understand your point of view i think the problems can be solved with experts that we can add to the teachers in class to avoid time loss and we have to make formations for teachers too to avoid the stimulus with the technical problems and i think we must do all of that because we have to use technology in operation because it can reduce inequalities between the students that 
01		 more affluence and the ones who live in less affluence situation so we have to do all that 
01		 yes indeed the problem for me is a very big problem to counter that we have to make plans to replace the material and also make updates that can be considered in the budget of the i think that's a problem but it can be we can do with that also yes you said that the students that have less money you can have the internet at home and that can be a issue with the own works and yes as you said we can provide them computers or 4g keys because that's very important you talked about 20th century skills learning before that's important all the students can have those 20th century skills and all the students that's important all of the students can have access to computers and the internet 
01		 yes you're totally right for this problem yes as you said we have to keep the pencil and paper based learning because as you said state programs are 
01		 traditional and the tests must be with pencil and paper so plus we have to keep this way of leaning because the time that spend young people on screens are already high so it must be not too high and because it can cause anxiety and the social skills can be compromised so yes we have indeed 
01		 the world to limit this time on the screen i agree with you but i think we can use a technology called running 
01		 okay so i'm glad that our students can provide the technological learning in the future
