00		 so hello today we are going to discuss about the issues the advantages to our stabilizer if we have to put a technology on the classroom if we don't have to implement this in the classroom so first i think that this is a good thing to implement this type of technology like computers in the classroom in the course in the school in general because i think the first students like it and there is already studies that have shown that there is a higher level of engagement 
00		 for example for students who don't like to talk because they are a little scared 
00		 i get your point here but i think that even if there is no computer on the classroom there is already a possible student who can play on the phone or some figures that already can distract can distract the other student behind them but i get your point here and i agree with you 
00		 okay i understand but i think that this is not a treat student who buy this computer i think that school wherever they are in must buy this computer for them like this is already happening in some area where the states give three computers to students and students don't have to pay them 
00		 ok ok maybe you want to say that this is a little lost of time and i think that this is a lost of time in the present but after i think that thanks to these technology and computers students will learn lessons and skills more faster so i think that the time will be gained after 
00		 okay i go along with you i think that all students and people today are a bit addicted to this type of technology like computers often but i think that this is the students or the people at home who have to reduce the time they are using this technology because it is very useful in the school i think 
00		 okay okay yes i think that we have to just not use them use the computers and this technology every day at school but i think this is a good idea to add computers in classroom and more it can help for future jobs because now all jobs will be like engineers for artificial intelligence and so we have to have a student who learn these type of skills to have a good job in the future 
00		 yes i agree we don't have to put children at like five or four years old roughly in this type of technology they have to be for a new life but yes we have to regulate them like maybe twice a week or maybe just a few just a few class or course so yes 
00		 okay so i think that we are finished and i agree with you with the twice a week and i think this is a good idea 
01		 hello i share your view but for me i think that new technologies are problems these technologies can distract the students when they are in class 
01		 for example if a student plays on his computer the user's student next to him can be detected by him 
01		 yeah it's true but another problem of new technology is the cost of this technology it's very expensive to buy a computer and at risk you can't count by a computer expensive and they can have a problem to to access to network connection when they are at home 
01		 a bio of a computer for at risk antigen the teacher needed to have a formation to 
01		 to know how to integrate this technology in class without a list of students 
01		 yeah i got along with you there but for me it's a good thing because a student can learn faster but the major problem is that the student has six or eight screen looks screen by day but if they use a screen at school it can increase the time spent on the looking screen and it can 
01		 yeah it's true for me we need to integrate this technology at school but we need to limit the time spent on the screen 
01		 it can be a tool to integrate at traditional method to run it's in addition to this traditional method 
01		 if we want to use this technology at school we need to regulate them and begin to use this technology not before a certain age like years or years 
01		 yes twice a week is a good idea because it keeps the advantage of this technology too long faster
