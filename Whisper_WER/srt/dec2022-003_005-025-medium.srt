1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Your candidate number?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
05.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Your candidate number is 005.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
005, and I'm role A.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And I'm candidate 025, and I'm role B.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, you can begin.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So I personally think that new technologies aren't any good in class,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and it should be something that is out of the school and not in the school.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, I understand your point of view, but today the technology is quite important

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
because we need computer to access to websites or things like this,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and teachers need to show things to the class or things like this.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, of course, I hear this, but I think that there are some studies that show that

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
there are two kinds of situations, I think.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There is when there are everyday new technologies, and it can represent a distraction.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And of course, on the other side, there can be like once a week a class with computer

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to learn new technologies to the student.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I agree, but I think that the foundation priorities should be the development of new way

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
with new technologies to learn and to teach for the kids.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's a better way to learn because they are more happy to be there.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They enjoy the class.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And for the teachers, it's more simple because they can use a lot of things

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and diversify how they work.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes, but we know for quite a time now that the amount of time that teens,

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
so students, pass on a device, like a smartphone, computer,

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
is a huge amount of time, like six to eight hours a day.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So we do not need to increase this time.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I agree with you, but technology is also a keyboard

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
or the things that can project an image on the keyboard.

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And it's not just a computer, so if we invest in the research of new technology,

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
we may discover the new way.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We do not need to be on a computer or iPad or something like this,

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
but we can be a technology and help the teacher.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is a good point, Moni.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If we want a new technology in class, this should be with great equipment, like you said,

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
not necessarily a computer per student,

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
but there will be some investment that we need to do.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And of course, there will be maybe instruction of teachers

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
because not all teachers know how to use a keyboard or computer for their course,

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
for mathematics, for example.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And so there is maybe inequality between a school that has the money for this

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and a school that doesn't have.

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I know that, and actually it doesn't really concern us.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's the government who has to help this school and this teacher,

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and also the parents because maybe the child is in a great school,

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
but he may have no money.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But it's the government who has to help the school,

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and we should offer them the opportunity to buy new stuff.

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I agree with you.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So if the government says that you will invest in this

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and of course give money to a school that doesn't have that much money,

51
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can eventually think that some technology on a certain level

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
with a minimum amount of time can be good

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
because of course this is not all bad.

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, but maybe we should just talk about this with the government

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
for communication and try to see what we can do.

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
But I think that even if we don't know what the government was going to say,

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
we know that we have to invest on new technology because it's too important.

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes, but we have to invest, but to invest we need to have money

59
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and to make sure that some people like government or other kind of people

60
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
will help and will do everything they can

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
so there isn't any inequality between school and between students

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
because this is the future of the country.

63
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So if some kids don't have the same education as others,

64
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
this will increase inequality.

65
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The government will choose to invest.

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's an evidence because there is too many...

67
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He knows he has to do it because the school needs this for work

68
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and work in a good way because we saw that the child

69
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and the teacher are happiest in the school when there is more technology.

70
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation,

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
technology can be slowly integrated in the classroom,

72
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
but with regulation, like I said, not every day, like once a week for example,

73
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
to start or like one hour a day or something like this.

74
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, I agree with you because we all know that the screen is bad for everyone,

75
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you say.

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So the teachers do this part, they have to adapt with the things that we offer to them.

77
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So we just have to agree with the fact that we invest and that's it.

78
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes, so I agree with you.
