1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
can we do that zero, three, nine, a row, eight?

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,160
Thank you.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,880
I'm going to do it zero, four, zero, I'm the world bee.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,160
Okay, thank you very much.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
You guys can begin.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,840
Okay.

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,840
So I think that we should introduce technology

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,760
to the classrooms and to the students.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,360
I think it would be great since we live now in a world

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,720
where technology is everywhere.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,160
I think our students are going to have

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,360
to experience some jobs that we don't know yet

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,680
that even probably doesn't don't exist yet.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,440
So I think that we really have to make them familiar

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,280
with technology, with computers,

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,720
and with using them in their daily life.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,760
So what do you think?

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,440
Yes, but don't you think that the children's

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,320
only use technology at school isn't too much

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,520
and they have to continue to write with their hands

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,920
and don't only use the new technology?

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,360
I don't think that we have to make them use

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,640
only technology, making them use it doesn't mean

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,880
that they won't be writing or anything besides,

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,440
they don't have to do it all the time.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,800
Because I think that they have to continue writing

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,480
because the jobs that use the right will continue.

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,440
So I think it would be great to moderate

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,800
between new technology and like whole school.

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,240
Yes, we could, but I also think that using technology

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,760
is very important because we are facing a new generation,

32
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,520
a new world with new ways to learn.

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,600
And I think that we should adapt the school system to this.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,560
It could increase their autonomy.

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,600
With more dialogue, the professor won't be there

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,640
just to stand here and talk and the students

37
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,200
won't be passive anymore.

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,520
I think it's important for them to learn them,

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,520
to be active, more active, and to increase their autonomy.

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,600
Yeah, but there is a problem that scientists proved

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,600
that and like therapist proved that use technology at school,

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
even children's use technology out from school.

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,480
So they use art school, out from school,

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,840
and it developed the anxiety for example,

45
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,840
and it can develop depression if they don't have access

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
to the technology.

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,560
So I think they get,

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,560
we have to make a balance between school and not school.

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
So we can make different classes, for example,

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,560
like if the parents want because they,

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,560
this is their choice when children are young

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
and make different class.

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Yes, I think that's interesting.

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,560
And I agree with you, they use screens

55
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,560
and internet and computers all the time.

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,560
It's a generation who was born with this

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,560
and who knows it may be better than us.

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,560
And I think that we should learn them how to make good things

59
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,560
and to use these computers and all these screens

60
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
usefully.

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,560
We have to learn them how to make it good,

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,560
how to do good things with it, how to use them

63
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,560
and use them to help them,

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,560
like even in the work at work at school,

65
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,560
because now the children are using these screens

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,560
and everything mostly to do not to work

67
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,560
to divertissement and everything.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,560
So I think it's important to learn them how to work with it

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
and how to make it useful.

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,560
But I don't think that for little parts,

71
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,560
yes, they will use it correctly,

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,560
but most of the children will want to go on Netflix

73
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,560
on YouTube and it's going to be a distraction

74
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,560
more than a real surprise.

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,560
Yeah, I think this is why the teachers are important

76
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
and this is why they are here

77
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,560
and they have to be well trained to involve to the children

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,560
the value of it that they have a chance

79
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:50,560
to have these computers and this technology.

80
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
And I think that if we learn them how to use them correctly

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,560
and not only for Netflix and everything

82
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
and playing games and everything,

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,560
I think that it can only be great.

84
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,560
They will know how to make it great.

85
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Yeah, but if you make a teacher,

86
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,560
make the transition and use technology

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,560
and if the teacher doesn't want to use it,

88
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
he will not use it correctly.

89
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,560
And I think it's just a transition

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,560
of what he knows before

91
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,560
and just with technology.

92
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,560
So it's not necessary useful.

93
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,560
Yeah, this is why we have to put a lot of financial resources

94
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,560
on this project to form correctly the teachers

95
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,560
so they actually know what to do

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,560
and not just do what they usually did on a computer

97
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
because this is nonsense,

98
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
this is not useful at all.

99
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,560
We have to train the teacher well

100
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,560
so they can transmit to the children the right thing

101
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
what we want them to do.

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,560
But who is going to pay for all this equipment?

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
The school are the parents

104
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
because it represents huge depends.

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,560
So not everyone can do it for all their children.

106
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,560
It represents a big difficulty.

107
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,560
This is how I think we should have a discussion

108
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,560
with the state and big associations

109
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,560
and everything to be allowed to afford it

110
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,560
and to offer everyone the same changes

111
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,560
to use technology usefully.

112
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Yes, and I think it's not possible

113
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,560
in a crisis, if there is a one,

114
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,560
like actually in Ukraine,

115
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,560
there is a repercussion in every country.

116
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,560
If we, in France, we want to do this

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
to put the technology at school,

118
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,560
the state cannot finance for any.

119
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,560
So you have to go back and use the old technical.

120
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,560
So I think it's not certain.

121
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
You cannot, for the moment, use it

122
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
because it's too expensive.

123
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,560
Teachers are still old.

124
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Maybe next generations

125
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,560
because they were born with this,

126
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,560
maybe they will use it correctly.

127
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,560
But I think for the moment it's not possible.

128
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Well, I think it's something that will take a long time.

129
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Of course, we cannot do it in a few years

130
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,560
and just it's not that fast.

131
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
It cannot be that fast.

132
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,560
But I think that on the long term,

133
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
we will be able to do this.

134
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,560
Of course, it will take a bit of time,

135
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
but this is now we have to start it.

136
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Okay, so it's going to be a transition.

137
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Yeah.

138
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Yeah, so maybe what we can do is

139
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,560
for a certain class trying to use it.

140
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Yeah, to test.

141
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Yeah, to test, like test.

142
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,560
And if it's beneficial or not,

143
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,560
maybe we will introduce it

144
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
for the new generations.

145
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Of course, but it has to be well done.

146
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Yeah.

147
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,560
And we don't have to discriminate any children.

148
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
We can test all the few classes.

149
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,560
But as it works when it's well done,

150
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,560
I think we should now start to think about finance this in priority.

151
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
Because I think this is the future.

152
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Yeah.

153
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,560
We have a generation that was born with this technology

154
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,560
and we have to adapt with it.

155
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
So maybe, I don't know, maybe,

156
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,560
abandon all the systems progressively

157
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,560
to, at the end,

158
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,560
to end up with this technology system being the main one.

159
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,560
And if it doesn't work

160
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
for the new generations,

161
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:14,560
is it not depends that we could evitate

162
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,560
and, for example,

163
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,560
use this money that we used for children

164
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,560
who doesn't have the chance to learn,

165
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,560
like in some certain poor country,

166
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
rather than use it for our school,

167
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
that we have...

168
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
I think we're speaking of our country

169
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,560
in that right now in our country,

170
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,560
mostly pretty much everyone has the change to go to school

171
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
and to learn.

172
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,560
So this is now we have to try new things.

173
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Maybe to help the poorest people

174
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
so they can have it later.

175
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Of course, it's going to be difficult.

176
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
But we can't know if we just spend money

177
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
on something that won't work.

178
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,560
If we don't try, we cannot know if it's going to work or not.

179
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Yeah.

180
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
If we don't try.

181
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
There is a problem.

182
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,560
If there is connection problem in a class,

183
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,560
the teacher cannot make his class.

184
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
For example, you know,

185
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,560
there is a risk that you don't have

186
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,560
with a traditional way of learning.

187
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,560
Yes, it can happen, of course.

188
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
I think this is why we should put some experts

189
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,560
on every school that could be able to

190
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
make any intervention at any moment

191
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,560
to solve the problem if it exists.

192
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,560
This is why I told you it has to be well organized.

193
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,560
If it's done just not...

194
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
If we don't put enough energy in it, it won't work.

195
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,560
This is why we have to put a lot of money right now

196
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
so it works well.

197
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,560
And then we're going to maybe be able

198
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,560
to have this technology system that will work

199
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,560
and it's going to be beneficial for everyone.

200
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Yeah, but I still think it's not a good idea

201
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,560
because you lose the...

202
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,560
you do have the discussion with the teacher,

203
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
you don't have the...

204
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,560
you will lose all your...

205
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,560
your abilities to go and have a discussion

206
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,560
with another people except behind the computer.

207
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
In the...

208
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,560
when you're going to work in your professional life,

209
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,560
you will have to discuss with, for example,

210
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,560
a client if you go in commercial way.

211
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,560
So I think you have to...

212
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,560
to use technology because, yeah,

213
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,560
I agree it's important for our generation.

214
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
So 100%.

215
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,560
But we have to stay with the traditional way.

216
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Yeah, I agree.

217
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,560
We have to keep nourishing the relationship between people.

218
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,560
We don't have to be like...

219
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,560
present and...

220
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
under the computer and everything.

221
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Yes, you're right.

222
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,560
We have to make a dialogue, a discussion

223
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,560
between the teacher that will be here to help the children

224
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
not only to learn them like magically,

225
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,560
just to discuss with them.

226
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
Yeah.

227
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,560
To increase the autonomy of the children

228
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,560
and their capacity to communicate with each other.

229
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Okay.
