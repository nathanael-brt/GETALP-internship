1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes, zero, one, seven.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Can you roll?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A roll, eight.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And yours please?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Zero, two, nine, and a whole bit.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, when you're ready, you guys can begin.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You have eight minutes to ten minutes.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And this means you have one minute left.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You can begin now.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You start.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Two.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How's your heart?

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay.

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to defend the fact that the school should remodelate the use of the technology

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
in the classroom, because there's a lot of negative points about it.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Like, it's not a good thing to be in-screen all day for a child, because it can develop

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and anxiety and the child can become and go more usually.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And they're not very concentrated when they're on a screen.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,400
No one can really watch what they're doing in front of the screen, so it can develop

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,400
a possible arsement, so it's why it should be in-moderate.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I personally think that have technology in classes, it's a new perspective of teaching,

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:36,400
and it enables students to be curious and search information online on topics they like.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,400
And also, ecologically speaking, it's good for environment, because we don't have to use paper.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,400
So I think it's quite good.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Well, what about the motivation of the use, because of the cyber arsement that can be made of?

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm listening to your point.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:15,400
I think it has this topic of technology in classes as pros and cons,

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,400
and your telling and cons that is arsement.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:32,400
But I think that things could be put to avoid arsement.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I don't have solutions.

32
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:47,400
But don't you think that people must not be very concentrated when they're not in front of the screen?

33
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,400
You know what I mean? When the teacher is speaking in a traditional way,

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,400
that you will think, okay, let's not be concentrated now and be concentrated on the screen because it's fun.

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:13,400
I have mixed feelings about that, because I think that technology can allow children or students and teachers

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,400
to have a dialogue, another dialogue from the classics school.

37
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I think also that now with the development of data, it's more practical.

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:41,400
To search online things than in books.

39
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:51,400
And how about the...

40
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Oh, I don't know.

41
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:06,400
What about the anxiety, the anger, and all the negative points that the studies show of the screen?

42
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Don't you think that a low children at home is usually on the screen, come to class?

43
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Also, a screen is a good thing for the development of the side.

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:27,400
I don't know, but it's a road to do a certain...

45
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,400
How do you say?

46
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,400
You can follow the line.

47
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:47,400
I think it's great to have technology in school and at home because for children,

48
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:57,400
it's more practical and for teachers.

49
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,400
It's a new perspective to teach and it's interesting for them.

50
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:12,400
But what about the people who are not very...

51
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Well, we don't really use the teacher, we don't really use the screen or everything.

52
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,400
And when you ask them to teach with the things that they didn't know how to use it.

53
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Yes.

54
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:48,400
The fact is that teachers in their childhood, in the last decade, weren't happy to use technology because it didn't exist.

55
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:59,400
But the thing is that they can now be coached and they can learn to...

56
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Learn to...

57
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,400
No, I don't know how to proceed.

58
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,400
So we can find a compromise, a compromise, yes.

59
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:27,400
I listen to what you are saying and I think that the screen is a good thing but it should be moderated.

60
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:39,400
It's not a no for me to be used at school but it should be moderated because of everything that is the consequence of the using of the screen.

61
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Yes.

62
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
I totally agree with you.

63
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,400
And I think one or two hours per day or per week, it's a good thing.

64
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Yeah.

65
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
And not no more.

66
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Yes.

67
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
It should be a...

68
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,400
The traditional way should be used.

69
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Yes.

70
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
And not only on the screen.

71
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Yeah.

72
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Both are perfect.
