1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, 38, situation 1 and role B.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes, the role, sorry.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Number 016, situation 1 and role A.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, what do you think about the priorities that we can call B in the matter of technology in the classroom?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Do you think it's a good thing?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Because I think, in my opinion, if you include more technology in the classroom,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
we are going to increase the knowledge and the skill of the students.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's a way to discover a new method. What do you think about that?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No, I disagree with you because I think it's more armed than good.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And schools should moderate using technology.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Indeed, social inequalities can be evocated because some students don't have the tools necessary

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and don't have access to computers or the internet, for example.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, I think it's not a good way to admit new technology in the classroom.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, and as you say, some students don't have access to the technology.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And do you think that if we put in class some computers and work just a little time at every class,

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
they can discover a new thing because they don't have it at their home?

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes, it's possible, but it's so expensive for the schools.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And the teacher must be formed and it's a major problem to develop new technologies.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's so expensive for the schools and it increases inequalities.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes, I agree with you. It's very expensive and teachers need very good training.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But I think it's a way to increase the curiosity of children and students.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And it may be a way for them to study in a way more exciting and more interesting for them.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, I think we need to find solutions.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There is not too much, but not at all.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What do you think?

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes, I agree with you on this point.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But the risk is to disconnect the students with the reality.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And I think it's more better to read a book, for example, than to learn with a computer.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And for example, in some countries, students don't have the possibility to buy good equipment

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and access of new technology increases social inequalities.

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes, but in the real life, when you have a job, a work, you need to know how to use a computer

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
because a lot of jobs are using computers for grading mail, do some studies.

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So, I think it's not good if there is too much.

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But they need a little bit every month or every day for increase their knowledge and skills for their future jobs.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So, which solution can we found together?

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, a little bit is a possibility.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And students pass exams, pass assessments, and the assessments were written.

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, I think it's possible to make...

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Some exercises, maybe, and some research.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, but a little bit.

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, and maybe it can be a good idea if they do some research in the Internet

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
for discovering a computer and how it's working, and maybe some exercises.

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But as you say, tests are on a paper with a pen.

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So, just a little bit for their curiosity and discovery.

45
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes, it's a good way to increase our knowledge.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes, and do you think it's a better solution if a teacher decided to do three hours of their courses on the computer

47
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,000
of maybe just an hour per day or three hours per month because they need?

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So, I understand that they don't need very much, but not less.

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes, one hour per day.

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a good solution, I think.

51
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And it's a good way to increase our capacity, our skills in different topics.

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, I think change the way of the learning, not just on the board with exercise paper and books

53
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
that can attract students.

54
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They can be more exciting to learning and more interesting on the courses.

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes, it's very beneficial. Benefits are good in this point.

56
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And as you already said, it's very expensive.

57
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes.

58
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, maybe not a computer for every student, but some computers in the class,

59
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and they can turn during three hours and some don't exercise on their papers and other on their computers.

60
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, and each student can be access to a computer.

61
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes.

62
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Can we also learn with a pen and a paper?

63
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Maybe we don't give homework at home on a computer for a variety of inequalities, as you said,

64
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
but do some exercises in the school.

65
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
In class, yes, in school.

66
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So, I think, like I already said, that school should moderate the using of technology.

67
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I think your proposition is very good for the students and the teacher.

68
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If I can conclude, maybe we can say that we are going to do many technologies in class,

69
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:58,000
three hours per day, but with rotations that are going to avoid the inequalities between students,

70
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and they can increase their knowledge and skills.

71
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Am I missing something?

72
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No, it's perfect. Thank you.
