022		Yes, my number is 022 and meets 010.
022		In my opinion, technology in class is very home and it's not good.
022		We use pen and papers for long decades, blackboard, books.
022		I'm not interested in technology.
022		It's a success, Roland.
022		Yes, but you see all the exams are passed in paper with pen.
022		We don't have tablets or computer in the exams.
022		Yes, but maybe we can do a part of technology and also a part of paper and pen.
022		I see, but for the students you talk before you know some studies spoke about
022		it raised anxiety and reduced self-esteem.
022		We could have issues of additivity of students.
022		Many students use the computer or the technology six to eight hours a day.
022		It's an often we don't have to use it in classroom.
022		I see a purpose, but the final point I want to talk about is technology is very expensive.
022		A lot of schools do not have many income and technology is very expensive.
022		How do you do with that?
022		I saw your purpose and why it's interesting.
022		I wanted to use interactive whiteboard in classroom.
022		It is very interesting, whiteboard or not.
022		Yes, it's okay.
022		We can sort the supervisor to buy some interactive whiteboard.
010		In my opinion, I think technology is a good idea and it's also an actual subject.
010		So it can help her teacher to organize her lesson.
010		And also for students, it can make the lesson more interesting and more interactive.
010		So I think it's a good idea.
010		So maybe the school can do during the year some exam for training the students to continue to write.
010		Maybe the school can organize a sensibilization of students to show that
010		to show the limits of technology, maybe like they can show that the students can also learn
010		read books and doesn't usually use the technology and also shows the limit of time screen.
010		For example, the nights when the students go to sleep if they have to
010		do not use the technology or screen.
010		Yes, yes, thank you.
010		I think the students that can pay for their computer can buy their own computer.
010		I think the schools have to prepare their budget before and I don't have a real solution for the money.
010		I think maybe for the school we can not invest in the computer, have to keep the traditional paper and pen.
010		Yes, yes, I think it's a good idea.
010		Because the students can participate with this?
Ens		010.
Ens		OK.
