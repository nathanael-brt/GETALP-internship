002		So I'm candidat002 and I'm the role A.
002		Well, hello, when you say, I don't know your name, I'm sorry.
002		I'm Carol.
002		Yeah.
002		Well, I'm pro-technology, I could say.
002		I believe we should implement technology more in the classroom,
002		but of course implement your regulations to make sure that the students learn from technology,
002		but not with it, and to make sure that their school experience is the best.
002		Well, the bullying is one of the risks that is really evident with social media,
002		and the fact that students are using it more and more,
002		and that their parents are having problems regulating it,
002		because they don't really understand their principle.
002		So that is why we could also try and implement strict rules regarding their devices.
002		Like an example was given of the fact that some teachers at the beginning of their classes
002		used to ask questions and students,
002		and it would be easier for students to answer the forums online,
002		and to make sure that those forums are only parts of the school website, for example,
002		and that are used by everyone,
002		and of course strict regulation regarding maybe course words,
002		and make sure that they are filters, etc.
002		Yeah, I remember teacher, sixth grade teacher,
002		if I remember, of the Fisher Middle School localizing you from the UK
002		that said in her classes,
002		she used around one hour of her time for the students to go online,
002		to use the screens, etc.
002		And I was a little bit surprised and unfounded,
002		unfounded to find that, because I think it's a little bit too much.
002		So we should implement rules regarding the hours,
002		make sure they don't spend too much time,
002		and that the screens they are on doesn't replace the students.
002		Yeah, that's a really interesting idea, John.
002		It's still a good idea, because it's still a combination
002		of normal, traditional ways of learning,
002		and also screens.
002		Like some said, a teacher said that she used Kagan structures,
002		which is a form of cooperative learning moment,
002		and also because they had little book clubs,
002		so they would use computers and tablets to learn a little bit more,
002		but they also had things outside of screens
002		by interacting with others and learning at the same time.
002		Well, yeah, currently technology is a bit of a working problem in progress.
002		Like we said, the technology has a real tool on mental health,
002		with anxiety, low self esteem, sometimes depression,
002		and yeah, some are more advantage,
002		because their parents, for example, have high incomes,
002		compared to others that don't really have access to computers
002		because their parents get afford to.
002		So, like I said before, try and regulate and also help
002		by funding schools so that each student can be able to access computers in school.
002		And I think we should do that also,
002		because we have a lot of learning to do,
002		but also learning techniques are present with technology.
002		Like this topic of constructivism,
002		an inquiry-based learning, for example,
002		where students are taught to search for topics in themselves,
002		and teachers are there to guide them.
002		And you can help with independence,
002		constructing a train of thoughts,
002		answering questions and understanding instructions.
002		Well, I think we can both agree that the main,
002		the foundation, the main priority,
002		is to ensure that technology is available to everyone,
002		but also that there are strict rules to make sure
002		that it doesn't end badly for the students themselves.
002		Yeah.
002		Thank you.
003		And I'm the candidat003 and the role B.
003		I'm John. I'm you.
003		Okay, nice to meet you.
003		We are talking today about the tactile duty on the classroom.
003		What do you think about?
003		Okay, I have absolutely any problem with the fact that students can learn with technologies.
003		But there's I think some aspects which are dangerous, such as bullying.
003		And for that, I think that we need to put in place a kind of system of control of the informatic tools.
003		And it has to be encoderated by the teachers,
003		when students are using it. What do you think about?
003		Yeah, and I think that they should also verify the history of the,
003		for example, the computers or all the devices,
003		which were used by the students.
003		It has to be moderated.
003		They don't have, I think, that they don't have to stay all day behind a screen,
003		and it has to be only used in an educated way, for example,
003		for homework, for researchers, something like that,
003		and absolutely in any case, for personal uses.
003		It's a very interesting idea, but it's dangerous if it's not well done.
003		Yeah, but we can also make a kind of open space,
003		or co-working space in this school,
003		and where there will be some technological devices,
003		which can be used every time of the day,
003		and could pay me to the students to work as they want,
003		with some teachers around who could look at what they are doing,
003		if it's in a link or not with the school,
003		and maybe put in place a system of card that they had to insert
003		in a kind of box,
003		which will vary five if they have already used in the day,
003		a computer, and making some, as you say, filters,
003		and reducing the time of use per day,
003		for example, to maximum one hour.
003		Yeah, and also there's not only computers or screens,
003		there's also the book club in which Kagan continued to learn
003		and to check all the information that they need for their works,
003		and also I was thinking about a sensibilization of the students,
003		but also the teachers of the schools about the impact psychologically,
003		and also physically, for example, the eye and the health.
003		And I think that this system of co-working space
003		with some informatic devices will permit to avoid the social
003		and economical fracture that there is between them,
003		as it was said, in an article between the white colors
003		and the black colors due to their origins and their lifestyle,
003		because many people who are of black skin color
003		don't have informatic devices for work.
003		Yeah, so I absolutely agree with all that you said.
003		I think that the thing that we have to put in place
003		is to moderate and control the behavior of the students
003		and moderate in function of the age of the students.
003		For example, the first great student
003		have to use in the maximum half hour per day the computers
003		and the last year students, for example,
003		maximum two hours to prepare their exams.
003		I don't know what you think about.
003		Yeah, so you agree with that?
003		Perfect, thank you.
