039		can we do that zero, three, nine, a row, eight?
039		So I think that we should introduce technology
039		to the classrooms and to the students.
039		I think it would be great since we live now in a world
039		where technology is everywhere.
039		I think our students are going to have
039		to experience some jobs that we don't know yet
039		that even probably doesn't don't exist yet.
039		So I think that we really have to make them familiar
039		with technology, with computers,
039		and with using them in their daily life.
039		So what do you think?
039		I don't think that we have to make them use
039		only technology, making them use it doesn't mean
039		that they won't be writing or anything besides,
039		they don't have to do it all the time.
039		Yes, we could, but I also think that using technology
039		is very important because we are facing a new generation,
039		a new world with new ways to learn.
039		And I think that we should adapt the school system to this.
039		It could increase their autonomy.
039		With more dialogue, the professor won't be there
039		just to stand here and talk and the students
039		won't be passive anymore.
039		I think it's important for them to learn them,
039		to be active, more active, and to increase their autonomy.
039		Yes, I think that's interesting.
039		And I agree with you, they use screens
039		and internet and computers all the time.
039		It's a generation who was born with this
039		and who knows it may be better than us.
039		And I think that we should learn them how to make good things
039		and to use these computers and all these screens
039		usefully.
039		We have to learn them how to make it good,
039		how to do good things with it, how to use them
039		and use them to help them,
039		like even in the work at work at school,
039		because now the children are using these screens
039		and everything mostly to do not to work
039		to divertissement and everything.
039		So I think it's important to learn them how to work with it
039		and how to make it useful.
039		Yeah, I think this is why the teachers are important
039		and this is why they are here
039		and they have to be well trained to involve to the children
039		the value of it that they have a chance
039		to have these computers and this technology.
039		And I think that if we learn them how to use them correctly
039		and not only for Netflix and everything
039		and playing games and everything,
039		I think that it can only be great.
039		They will know how to make it great.
039		Yeah, this is why we have to put a lot of financial resources
039		on this project to form correctly the teachers
039		so they actually know what to do
039		and not just do what they usually did on a computer
039		because this is nonsense,
039		this is not useful at all.
039		We have to train the teacher well
039		so they can transmit to the children the right thing
039		what we want them to do.
039		This is how I think we should have a discussion
039		with the state and big associations
039		and everything to be allowed to afford it
039		and to offer everyone the same changes
039		to use technology usefully.
039		Well, I think it's something that will take a long time.
039		Of course, we cannot do it in a few years
039		and just it's not that fast.
039		It cannot be that fast.
039		But I think that on the long term,
039		we will be able to do this.
039		Of course, it will take a bit of time,
039		but this is now we have to start it.
039		Yeah.
039		Yeah, to test.
039		Of course, but it has to be well done.
039		And we don't have to discriminate any children.
039		We can test all the few classes.
039		But as it works when it's well done,
039		I think we should now start to think about finance this in priority.
039		Because I think this is the future.
039		We have a generation that was born with this technology
039		and we have to adapt with it.
039		So maybe, I don't know, maybe,
039		abandon all the systems progressively
039		to, at the end,
039		to end up with this technology system being the main one.
039		I think we're speaking of our country
039		in that right now in our country,
039		mostly pretty much everyone has the change to go to school
039		and to learn.
039		So this is now we have to try new things.
039		Maybe to help the poorest people
039		so they can have it later.
039		Of course, it's going to be difficult.
039		But we can't know if we just spend money
039		on something that won't work.
039		If we don't try, we cannot know if it's going to work or not.
039		If we don't try.
039		Yes, it can happen, of course.
039		I think this is why we should put some experts
039		on every school that could be able to
039		make any intervention at any moment
039		to solve the problem if it exists.
039		This is why I told you it has to be well organized.
039		If it's done just not...
039		If we don't put enough energy in it, it won't work.
039		This is why we have to put a lot of money right now
039		so it works well.
039		And then we're going to maybe be able
039		to have this technology system that will work
039		and it's going to be beneficial for everyone.
039		Yeah, I agree.
039		We have to keep nourishing the relationship between people.
039		We don't have to be like...
039		present and...
039		under the computer and everything.
039		We have to make a dialogue, a discussion
039		between the teacher that will be here to help the children
039		not only to learn them like magically,
039		just to discuss with them.
039		To increase the autonomy of the children
039		and their capacity to communicate with each other.
040		I'm going to do it zero, four, zero, I'm the world bee.
040		Okay.
040		Yes, but don't you think that the children's
040		only use technology at school isn't too much
040		and they have to continue to write with their hands
040		and don't only use the new technology?
040		Because I think that they have to continue writing
040		because the jobs that use the right will continue.
040		So I think it would be great to moderate
040		between new technology and like whole school.
040		Yeah, but there is a problem that scientists proved
040		that and like therapist proved that use technology at school,
040		even children's use technology out from school.
040		So they use art school, out from school,
040		and it developed the anxiety for example,
040		and it can develop depression if they don't have access
040		to the technology.
040		So I think they get,
040		we have to make a balance between school and not school.
040		So we can make different classes, for example,
040		like if the parents want because they,
040		this is their choice when children are young
040		and make different class.
040		But I don't think that for little parts,
040		yes, they will use it correctly,
040		but most of the children will want to go on Netflix
040		on YouTube and it's going to be a distraction
040		more than a real surprise.
040		Yeah, but if you make a teacher,
040		make the transition and use technology
040		and if the teacher doesn't want to use it,
040		he will not use it correctly.
040		And I think it's just a transition
040		of what he knows before
040		and just with technology.
040		So it's not necessary useful.
040		But who is going to pay for all this equipment?
040		The school are the parents
040		because it represents huge depends.
040		So not everyone can do it for all their children.
040		It represents a big difficulty.
040		Yes, and I think it's not possible
040		in a crisis, if there is a one,
040		like actually in Ukraine,
040		there is a repercussion in every country.
040		If we, in France, we want to do this
040		to put the technology at school,
040		the state cannot finance for any.
040		So you have to go back and use the old technical.
040		So I think it's not certain.
040		You cannot, for the moment, use it
040		because it's too expensive.
040		Teachers are still old.
040		Maybe next generations
040		because they were born with this,
040		maybe they will use it correctly.
040		But I think for the moment it's not possible.
040		Okay, so it's going to be a transition.
040		Yeah, so maybe what we can do is
040		for a certain class trying to use it.
040		Yeah, to test, like test.
040		And if it's beneficial or not,
040		maybe we will introduce it
040		for the new generations.
040		Yeah.
040		Yeah.
040		And if it doesn't work
040		for the new generations,
040		is it not depends that we could evitate
040		and, for example,
040		use this money that we used for children
040		who doesn't have the chance to learn,
040		like in some certain poor country,
040		rather than use it for our school,
040		that we have...
040		Yeah.
040		There is a problem.
040		If there is connection problem in a class,
040		the teacher cannot make his class.
040		For example, you know,
040		there is a risk that you don't have
040		with a traditional way of learning.
040		Yeah, but I still think it's not a good idea
040		because you lose the...
040		you do have the discussion with the teacher,
040		you don't have the...
040		you will lose all your...
040		your abilities to go and have a discussion
040		with another people except behind the computer.
040		In the...
040		when you're going to work in your professional life,
040		you will have to discuss with, for example,
040		a client if you go in commercial way.
040		So I think you have to...
040		to use technology because, yeah,
040		I agree it's important for our generation.
040		So 100%.
040		But we have to stay with the traditional way.
040		Yes, you're right.
040		Yeah.
040		Okay.
Ens		Thank you.
Ens		Okay, thank you very much.
Ens		You guys can begin.
