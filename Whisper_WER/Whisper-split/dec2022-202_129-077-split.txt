129		Number 129, roll A. Number 767, roll B. So hello, today we are going to discuss about
129		the issues we are going to suggest to our supervisor if we have to put technologies on
129		the classroom if we don't have to implement this in the classroom. So first, I think that
129		this is a good thing to implement this type of technology like computers in the classroom
129		in the course and the school in general because I think the first students like it and there
129		is already studies that have showed that there is a higher level of engagement. For example,
129		for students who don't like to talk because they are a little scared.
129		I get short point here, but I think that even if there is no computer on the classroom,
129		there is already a possible student who can play on the phone or something else.
129		And that already can distract the other students behind them, but I get short point here and I agree with you.
129		Okay, I understand, but I think that this is not the athletes' student who buy this computer.
129		I think that school where they are in must buy this computer for them.
129		Like this is already happening in some area where the state gives free computers to students and students don't have to pay them.
129		Maybe you want to say that this is a little lost of time and I think that this is a lost of time in the present.
129		But after, I think that thanks to these technology and computers, students will learn lessons and skills more fast, faster.
129		So I think that the time will be gained after.
129		Okay, I go along with you.
129		I think that all students and people today are a bit addicted to this type of technology like computers or fun.
129		But I think that this is the students or the people at home who have to reduce the time they are using this technology because it is very useful in the school I think.
129		Okay, okay. Yes, I think that we have to just not use them, use the computers and this technology every day at school.
129		But I think this is a good idea to add computers in classroom and more.
129		It can help for future jobs because now all jobs will be like engineers for artificial intelligence.
129		And so we have to have a student who learn this type of skills to have a good jobs in the future.
129		Yes, I agree.
129		We don't have to put children at like five or four years old, directly in this type of technology.
129		We have to before know the life.
129		But yes, we have to regulate them like maybe twice a week or maybe just a few class or a course.
129		Okay, so I think that we are finished and I agree with you with the twice a week and I think this is a good idea.
077		Hello, I share your view. But for me, I think that new technologies have problems.
077		These technologies can distract the students when they are in class. For example, if a student
077		can play on this computer, those other students next to him can be distracted by them.
077		Yeah, it's true, but another problem of new technology is the cost of this technology.
077		It's very expensive to buy a computer and at risk a student can't buy a computer expensive
077		and they can have problems to access to network connection when they are at home.
077		And it can create a...
077		It creates a disadvantage for these students.
077		It's a good idea, but for me, moreover, a buy of a computer for at risk a student,
077		the teacher needs to have a formation to know how to integrate this technology in class without a student.
077		Yeah, I got on with you there, but for me it's a good thing because a student can learn faster.
077		But the major problem is that the students have a sixth or eighth screen by day.
077		But if they use the screen at school, it can increase this time spend on the looking screen.
077		And it can provide anxiety for the students.
077		Yeah, it's true.
077		And for me, we need to integrate this technology at school, but we need to limit the time spent on this screen.
077		It can be a tool to integrate at a traditional method to learn.
077		It's in addition to this traditional method.
077		Firstly, it's a good thing for a job in the future that if we want to use this technology at school, we need to regulate them and begin to use this technology.
077		But before a certain age, like six years or ten years?
077		Yes, twice a week is a good idea because it keeps the advantage of this technology too long faster and it reduces the anxiety of the screen.
