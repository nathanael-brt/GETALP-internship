023		So we are here to different our position on the foundation which is that could be in
023		a better technology in the classroom. For me, I think that technology in school could
023		harm more than be good for students. For me schools should be moderated their
023		utilization of new technology.
023		Okay, I understand you point of view but for me I think that it could improve their
023		capacities but it also could distract them where they are in class and they just look
023		at the screen and for me and for therapists also students and young people are already
023		too much in front of a screen. We can heard before that they are six or eight hours per day
023		in front of a screen and if new technologies are allowed in school we couldn't
023		reduce this screen time.
023		Do you think that technologies can interest students more than if they are just with a pen?
023		Yeah, I couldn't agree more with you in this point and I think we can have a compromise
023		with this. For me I think that a little time of screen in school couldn't have
023		bad effect on the students because they have to live with their time but I think
023		school should moderate their use.
023		Okay, yeah, I agree with you.
023		And for you, what is the perfect time in the day for students?
023		Yeah, I agree with you with that.
023		And I also think that if there are more than one or two hours per day in front of a screen like
023		the therapist, I agree with this.
023		Students could have a addiction to technologies and their screen and their phone.
023		Yeah, I agree with you on this.
023		And to talk about another point, what do you think technology could do between students
023		who don't have a lot of money and don't have access to technologies.
023		And the students who already had a phone, a computer and others.
023		Yeah, yeah, I understand what you just said.
023		So to sum up, we agreed that one hour of technology and screen per day in school, it's okay.
023		It's not too much.
023		Okay, I agree with you on this.
009		Okay, so in my opinion the technology in school is not harm but is like an experience
009		and a thing to improve the learning of these students and the express of these students.
009		Okay, I could consider eight that can distract students but I think the students
009		are wondering the learn and they can be more, I don't know, but...
009		Yes, it's like they are in her house and it's more familiar for him to take
009		technologies and to simply learn.
009		Yes, they need to restrict the time of the students in the screen because I think
009		the students can be more able to deal with if they have a good situation
009		and to use it.
009		I think that's half an hour for day, it's a good time for students because
009		extend this time the students were not concentrated in the school.
009		Yes, my meanwhile the school, some students have an addiction with the screen.
009		And the school didn't under the phone.
009		And the school have a goal and this goal is to learn.
009		And I think that's the learning can be passed with the screen with technology.
009		But it's not the only goal of school.
009		It's not the school of technology, it's school.
009		So it's school to learn not to disrespect.
009		I think it's great disparities between a school who have technology who have technology.
009		And these disparities need to be put, not protected, but limited, I think.
009		Because if we create disparities, we need to involve the fact that we can have people with or not technology.
009		And it's simply to school to create an environment for Android technology and school.
009		And not just for show us the disparity between this person or this person who have technology and who haven't.
009		It's a good condition for students, I think.
009		And to conclude, yes, technology is create disparities.
009		But it also creates good moments for students.
009		And they can just enjoy to stand up for in school.
009		And that's my point.
