120		Yes.
120		I think I have a clear, clear, clear, clear pause issue about animal testing.
120		I just think this is an archaic method, completely outdated, and we have to just think about
120		how we can do this experience without animal testing.
120		Because that's just wasting money for nothing, because any solution could replace this animal
120		testing experience.
120		Okay.
120		Okay, I correct you just in one point.
120		Maybe in the past, it was a very great solution.
120		It was completely great to understand, as you say, the functioning of our belief, understand
120		our physical constructions, but today, we have to think ethically and we humanize our science.
120		It's great to me.
120		But before we don't want to be anything to kill any day, for example, we can use animals
120		Okay.
120		Okay.
120		It's false.
120		It's the same virus.
120		Yes.
120		What do you think about to create a process of experimentation in vitro, by example,
120		for, in the same time, in the second time, we can effectively create a program in computer
120		modellization, which are very, very, very performance, more, maybe, more, in the, in the
120		other, lot of time, maybe, more performance, that's animal testing, where, computer modellization
120		are more efficient in a lot of time, but it's not a question, so, we could, we could
120		say that, okay, it was the past, we did animal testing, and we know the functioning of
120		our body, and the body, and the cellular, that, that create disease, et cetera, okay.
120		But now, it's time to, transit to a way of science, which are more human, and when, we
120		didn't talk about money, what money?
120		suppression, as you say, to have, when we are, when we are in the program, in the RS program,
120		in the RS program, or RS program, you know, or with the, we are just seeing the trigger. So,
120		if we are, coming in, or RS program, trigger, we have more subventions, and that could be
120		transition step, between, between the, the experience with animals, and without animals. But,
120		I just want to, to say, one, one, one, one thing, one fact, 26 billions of dollars, that have been
120		invests in, experience animal testing, and just 95 persons did not succeed, we didn't translate
120		the medicant for human, that we test on animals. Yes, it's really good. We could put all this money
120		on computing, computer modelization, which, increase, which will be, which will increase more and
120		more, the performance of, computing, computer modelization. Yes, but like I said, it's not about
120		Oh, sorry, I'm not in scientific lessons, or grades, or so we don't have the buzzes. So, we have
120		acceleration, acceleration of the triage. We cannot accelerate it. When the triage has been
120		25 years? 25 years? No, we have to create the acceleration of triage, that could be
120		create a compromise with your review. I have to get a compromise, your review. No, no, no, no,
120		you want to skip the animal testing in the 25 years. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I want to write
120		our article. Our article. Our article. Create a barrier between us, you man, that we are just
120		exploiting the rest of nature. It's just outdated. It was in the 19th, in the 20th century. Okay,
120		it was great, and we understand the function of genesis, etc. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We have
120		notify that we could accelerate the triage metals at the conclusion, at the conclusion,
120		at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the
120		last, the last song of the fence. Oh, you, you are, you are, you are, you are, but we are okay to say
120		that 25 years to skip the animal testing is two. Three ago. Okay.
034		When you're ready, okay, so we should write some article about animal testing.
034		What do you think about it?
034		Okay, so we have a problem because I disagree.
034		I think we should write this article in favor of animal testing, because this method
034		allows breakthrough in science and research for scientific and to understanding the human
034		body and human disease and everything.
034		So for me, animal testing is the right method to allow the humanity to have a better life
034		with understanding this function.
034		But we can do that, we humanize our science, and you think animals like in a better way
034		than before.
034		and testing animals for some subject, but not for other, like, for example, cosmetic testing
034		animals.
034		It's a shame.
034		An nonsense.
034		No, because we have alternatives, but like, for example, human disease, sometimes we
034		don't have the correct alternative, like, for example.
034		No, as I'm saying, in the case of Alzheimer's, in the mask, we have, we can cure mice who
034		have Alzheimer's, but we cannot translate it for now, at the human, because we didn't understand
034		the molecular basis, but to take an alternative, we can use, for example, a computer alternative.
034		But to use it, we have to understand the molecular basis.
034		So if we don't have the molecular analysis, we cannot use alternative, before you have
034		to find the alternative by animal testing, what do you think?
034		We are the subventions, because we are, legally, we have, legally, the obligation to do animal
034		testing, it's right in a lot of creative ways. Yes, but a lot of, there, there is more
034		efficient, and increase the development, it's about reality, and reality, and point of the world.
034		It's like, if you don't understand the buzzes, yes, you can, we know the buzzes. No, we don't know
034		the buzzes, we know the buzzes. So, how, what is the basis of other animals?
034		to find it, maybe, maybe you're right, and maybe we can take the point of view of the
034		middle, like the triage. I'm okay with the triage, but with the triage, maybe, maybe, maybe
034		created, 15th, in the 15th. Yes, but it's a plan of long time. Are you okay to say that it's
034		outdated? We have to create a new model with acceleration, but we can't skip the animal testing,
034		in the future, in the future. No, in the future, we can't, but no, we can't. How many years?
034		the speed triage. Okay, so, alternative. We write our article about the triage, and you do your
034		research about the speed triage after the article. No, didn't? No, we could just complete,
034		to write an article and choose an article. Okay, so, so, you can write, it's outdated.
034		I can write. No, no, no, listen to me. You write, it's outdated. I write, we still do it,
034		and we write the triage metals. Yes, we've read it. Okay, could we just
