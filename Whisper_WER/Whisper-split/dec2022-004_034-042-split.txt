034		I think technology is the future, but she has a many many problems because the students
034		are already exposed to this technology out of the school, so that's why I think we should
034		moderate that use and maybe we can put a
034		plage of of of hours still for example one hour for today and after we continue the
034		traditional way exercise like papers and books and I agree with you to
034		we should develop that point in the school yes but what do you think about the psychology of our
034		students if we expose too much our students to technology we know that it's a possibility for them
034		to develop anxiety and I think that can degrade their their relationships so I think we have
034		to take this in consideration and maybe don't put them really faster to the technology right now
034		sensibilization we could make a place of sensibilization for parents and for students to show us
034		the danger of the technology and maybe debate of the benefits and yes I totally agree with you
034		and there is another thing we are not really agree for the technology using this school
034		I hope the technology will not
034		use for the homework because there is disparity social and I think that some students are not
034		the capacity or the materials way to have a computer that they're on or so I think it's important
034		you said two hours per day I am agree with that solution because I think two hours is not
034		too much one hour is is not enough okay but two hours you have the time to make many things
034		example plastic art mathematics English okay I think we can use for mathematics French
034		lesson just for grammar exercise one is about reduction I prefer paper of course but for just
034		simple exercise computer technology is great way and mathematics of course physical one is
034		possible SVT you can okay well you can use the technology for see video and it is more you know
042		keep using books papers and traditional way of learning but in my opinion technology
042		provides extensive opportunities for students it's a way for them to develop new skills and their
042		creativity by using devices like tablets, computers etc and it's a new way of learning for them
042		it can develop their interest for what we we are studying and like you said they already use
042		electronic devices so developing learning by technology is really in our area and that's why I think
042		yes I agree we should limit the use of technology in school like two hours per day maybe
042		that could be interesting to to experiment that way of learning what do you think about a class of
042		I think it could be necessary to learn to parents and students the dangers of internet the
042		extreme use of electronic devices on health for example on the ice and concentration etc
042		to let the technology in into school yes or another solution is to ask parents if they have
042		electronic devices at home and for the students who don't have electronic devices to do homework
042		maybe school can provide us them a computer to to do their homeworks for example if they have to
042		do expose that could be a solution for them to to work at home with technology okay
042		time
042		what time do you think we should impose to use technology at school
042		and I think it's enough okay and in what in what class do you think we should use it for
042		attractive for students okay I agree I think we should put in place two hours per day for
042		these classes
