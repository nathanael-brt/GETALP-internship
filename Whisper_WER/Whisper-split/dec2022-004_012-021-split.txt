012		I'd like to say that the use of technology in the classroom is not always good, it can
012		bring a lot of harm to students and also to the school as well.
012		First of all, I'd like to say it's expensive to implement, you need to buy the goods like computers
012		and boards, and also the equipment that you need to maintain the computers.
012		Indeed, it could be the role of the state to provide, but you have also to take an account
012		of the fact that teachers need to be trained, which also costs money and time away from
012		the students who could benefit of a more traditional way of education, so where would
012		that money come from?
012		So don't you think that progressively the teacher won't be needed and it could lead to unemployment?
012		If their children are able to study without teachers and just using technology, maybe
012		one day it will go too far and we will lose the profession that is teaching?
012		In fact, this is a good argument, but I think that we should also take account in account
012		that technology at school could have a negative impact on the student life as far for the
012		screen time, because technology is present everywhere, so at home also, and if there is
012		no break between use at home and at school, it can lead to addiction and problems like anxiety.
012		So what I hear you say is that the traditional way of teaching is still needed, and therefore
012		it also shows that technology has maybe not spread in a classroom, if you still need
012		the balance between traditional teaching and technology.
012		So I think technology can be useful, but you also have to take account that not everyone
012		has access to it, and if maybe we start using it, then we have to homework to do with
012		it, and researches, and some students don't have access to that because of low income.
012		That keeps them disadvantaged them.
012		But I also hear that it's a very expensive project, like I said, to buy the computers, to
012		keep the maintenance up, everything.
012		I don't think every school, every state has the money for that in every school, and more
012		over.
012		When maintenance is needed, you can't use the technology, so you can also slow down
012		the learning process while it's in maintenance.
012		While computers, technology devices are in maintenance, they can't be used, so it slows
012		down the learning process.
012		What about exams, because when you learn to take on a computer or to work on a computer
012		and then you find yourself in front of a sheet and a traditional way of writing exams,
012		if you students may be lost, because they are not that used to it.
012		I hear you, and I feel like we can go to a compromise where we think that technology can
012		be used, but with limits and work that in the schools with the teacher who need a lot
012		of training.
021		Yeah, but I think that is the role of the states, the states need to pay for all of it because
021		it's his job to provide to all students to have the equipment required for good learning and
021		good teaching.
021		Yes, but to my mind, the new teachers will bring the new 21st century children, so they
021		will grow up with the new technology, so we will need to teach them less than actually
021		with the old teacher.
021		No, because I'm not saying that robots can replace teachers.
021		I just think that the technology, sorry, is a tool for teachers to help the students
021		or the child to make more research.
021		It's a tool that they can use, for example, to go far away from their, from what they
021		know.
021		The teacher can not know everything, so when, for example, they work on the project
021		or something, they can use the technology to help them to work, to reach new methods
021		of working, of teaching.
021		Yes, I agree, but that is our work, that is a teacher work and parents work.
021		We need to control the time that the child spent on the screen, for example.
021		We can work only two hours a day on screen, sorry, screens at school, and the parents
021		can control the times when the child will come back at home.
021		So the child will not spend too much time on the screen, and we can do like exercise,
021		like who seems like feedback, to talk about what did you see on screen, what did you
021		think to make, to share together with the children, to have their feelings about the screen,
021		and to check if they are good with it.
021		That's why I think that the state's best pay for it, because I think, for example, the
021		states can buy computers or some adversities for the school.
021		The school we rented to the students, so they will have all the same computers, all the
021		same advices, so they will be not, like I say, disparities, I can say it like this,
021		disparities between them.
021		It will be easier for the teacher because they will have all the same computers or adversities,
021		and they will not be disparities because they will work, they will be equal, I see.
021		Could you repeat?
021		Not, because to my mind, the learning process is not based on technology, it's just a
021		tool that they can use to help them, it's not the majority of the works, so it will not
021		be like something missing when they are in maintenance, you understand.
021		The teacher will work with, like you said, traditional methods, but they can use the technology
021		to help them to bring new methods, to adapt their methods to students which are maybe
021		different, maybe who wants to discover something, different, because they have a different
021		level, for example.
021		To my mind, it depends of the skills.
021		For example, if in class they used to work mathematics without a computer, they should
021		do the exam without the computer, but if they work something like a French with the
021		computers, they will pass the exam with the computers, too.
021		Like this, they will have the habits.
021		Exactly, like I said, the technology will not be the base of the teaching, it will be just
021		a plus tools that can be used by the teacher to help the children.
