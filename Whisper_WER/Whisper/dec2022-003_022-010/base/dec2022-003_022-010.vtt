00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Yes, my number is 022 and meets 010.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
010.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
OK.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.000
In my opinion, technology in class is very home and it's not good.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
We use pen and papers for long decades, blackboard, books.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm not interested in technology.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
It's a success, Roland.

00:33.000 --> 00:41.000
In my opinion, I think technology is a good idea and it's also an actual subject.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
So it can help her teacher to organize her lesson.

00:48.000 --> 01:00.000
And also for students, it can make the lesson more interesting and more interactive.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
So I think it's a good idea.

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
Yes, but you see all the exams are passed in paper with pen.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
We don't have tablets or computer in the exams.

01:14.000 --> 01:27.000
Yes, but maybe we can do a part of technology and also a part of paper and pen.

01:27.000 --> 01:41.000
So maybe the school can do during the year some exam for training the students to continue to write.

01:41.000 --> 01:51.000
I see, but for the students you talk before you know some studies spoke about

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
it raised anxiety and reduced self-esteem.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
We could have issues of additivity of students.

02:01.000 --> 02:08.000
Many students use the computer or the technology six to eight hours a day.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
It's an often we don't have to use it in classroom.

02:14.000 --> 02:24.000
Maybe the school can organize a sensibilization of students to show that

02:24.000 --> 02:34.000
to show the limits of technology, maybe like they can show that the students can also learn

02:34.000 --> 02:51.000
read books and doesn't usually use the technology and also shows the limit of time screen.

02:51.000 --> 03:02.000
For example, the nights when the students go to sleep if they have to

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
do not use the technology or screen.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Yes, yes, thank you.

03:12.000 --> 03:22.000
I see a purpose, but the final point I want to talk about is technology is very expensive.

03:22.000 --> 03:30.000
A lot of schools do not have many income and technology is very expensive.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
How do you do with that?

03:36.000 --> 03:53.000
I think the students that can pay for their computer can buy their own computer.

03:54.000 --> 04:09.000
I think the schools have to prepare their budget before and I don't have a real solution for the money.

04:09.000 --> 04:27.000
I think maybe for the school we can not invest in the computer, have to keep the traditional paper and pen.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
I saw your purpose and why it's interesting.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
I wanted to use interactive whiteboard in classroom.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
It is very interesting, whiteboard or not.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
Yes, yes, I think it's a good idea.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
Because the students can participate with this?

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Yes, it's okay.

05:01.000 --> 05:09.000
We can sort the supervisor to buy some interactive whiteboard.
