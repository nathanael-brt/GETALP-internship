00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Yes. My number is 022.

00:04.480 --> 00:05.840
022?

00:05.840 --> 00:08.160
And me it's 010.

00:08.160 --> 00:09.360
010, okay.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.840
In my opinion, technology in class is very

00:16.640 --> 00:26.160
hard and it's not good. We use pen and papers for long decades, blackboard, books. I'm

00:27.120 --> 00:31.040
not interested in technology. It's successful.

00:33.680 --> 00:40.320
In my opinion, I think technology is a good idea and it's also an actual subject.

00:41.200 --> 00:51.600
So it can help a teacher to organize her lesson and also for students it can be

00:51.600 --> 01:01.840
a way to make the lesson more interesting and more interactive. So I think it's a good idea.

01:02.960 --> 01:10.160
Yes, but you see in all the exams that are passed in paper with pen,

01:10.160 --> 01:13.760
we don't have tablets or computers in the exams.

01:14.320 --> 01:24.080
Yes, but maybe we can do a part of technology and also a part of paper and

01:26.000 --> 01:39.520
pen. So maybe the school can do during the year some exam for training the students to continue to

01:39.520 --> 01:49.280
write. I see, but for the students you talked before, you know some studies

01:49.840 --> 01:57.680
spoke about it raises anxiety and reduces self-esteem. We could have issues of

01:59.360 --> 02:07.120
addictivity of students. Many students use computer technology six to eight hours

02:07.120 --> 02:11.280
a day. It's enough and we don't have to use it in classroom.

02:14.000 --> 02:25.680
Maybe the school can organize a sensibilization of students to show the limits of technology.

02:25.760 --> 02:40.800
Maybe they can show that the students can also read books and don't usually use technology

02:41.600 --> 02:55.600
and also show the limit of time screen. For example, the nights when the students go to

02:55.600 --> 03:18.000
sleep if they don't use technology. I see your purpose, but the final point I want to

03:18.960 --> 03:23.520
talk about is technology is very expensive. A lot of schools

03:26.080 --> 03:33.360
do not have many income and technology is very expensive. How do you do with that?

03:33.360 --> 03:52.320
I think the students that can pay for their computer can buy their own computer.

03:53.120 --> 04:08.480
I think the school has to prepare a budget before and I don't have a real solution for the money.

04:09.440 --> 04:24.800
I think maybe for the school who can not invest in a computer they have to keep the traditional

04:24.800 --> 04:37.280
paper and pen. I saw your purpose and why it's interesting. I'm ready to act to use

04:37.280 --> 04:44.240
interactive whiteboard in classroom. Is it interesting the whiteboard or not?

04:45.680 --> 04:56.800
Yes, I think it's a good idea because the students can participate with this.

04:56.800 --> 05:11.920
Okay, so it's okay. We can show the supervisor to buy some interactive whiteboard.
