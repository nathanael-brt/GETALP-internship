0	4480	Yes. My number is 022.
4480	5840	022?
5840	8160	And me it's 010.
8160	9360	010, okay.
12800	15840	In my opinion, technology in class is very
16640	26160	hard and it's not good. We use pen and papers for long decades, blackboard, books. I'm
27120	31040	not interested in technology. It's successful.
33680	40320	In my opinion, I think technology is a good idea and it's also an actual subject.
41200	51600	So it can help a teacher to organize her lesson and also for students it can be
51600	61840	a way to make the lesson more interesting and more interactive. So I think it's a good idea.
62960	70160	Yes, but you see in all the exams that are passed in paper with pen,
70160	73760	we don't have tablets or computers in the exams.
74320	84080	Yes, but maybe we can do a part of technology and also a part of paper and
86000	99520	pen. So maybe the school can do during the year some exam for training the students to continue to
99520	109280	write. I see, but for the students you talked before, you know some studies
109840	117680	spoke about it raises anxiety and reduces self-esteem. We could have issues of
119360	127120	addictivity of students. Many students use computer technology six to eight hours
127120	131280	a day. It's enough and we don't have to use it in classroom.
134000	145680	Maybe the school can organize a sensibilization of students to show the limits of technology.
145760	160800	Maybe they can show that the students can also read books and don't usually use technology
161600	175600	and also show the limit of time screen. For example, the nights when the students go to
175600	198000	sleep if they don't use technology. I see your purpose, but the final point I want to
198960	203520	talk about is technology is very expensive. A lot of schools
206080	213360	do not have many income and technology is very expensive. How do you do with that?
213360	232320	I think the students that can pay for their computer can buy their own computer.
233120	248480	I think the school has to prepare a budget before and I don't have a real solution for the money.
249440	264800	I think maybe for the school who can not invest in a computer they have to keep the traditional
264800	277280	paper and pen. I saw your purpose and why it's interesting. I'm ready to act to use
277280	284240	interactive whiteboard in classroom. Is it interesting the whiteboard or not?
285680	296800	Yes, I think it's a good idea because the students can participate with this.
296800	311920	Okay, so it's okay. We can show the supervisor to buy some interactive whiteboard.
