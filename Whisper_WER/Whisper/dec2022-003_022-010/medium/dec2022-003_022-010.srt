1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Yes. My number is 022.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,840
022?

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,160
And me it's 010.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,360
010, okay.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,840
In my opinion, technology in class is very

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:26,160
hard and it's not good. We use pen and papers for long decades, blackboard, books. I'm

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,040
not interested in technology. It's successful.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,320
In my opinion, I think technology is a good idea and it's also an actual subject.

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:51,600
So it can help a teacher to organize her lesson and also for students it can be

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:01,840
a way to make the lesson more interesting and more interactive. So I think it's a good idea.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,160
Yes, but you see in all the exams that are passed in paper with pen,

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,760
we don't have tablets or computers in the exams.

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:24,080
Yes, but maybe we can do a part of technology and also a part of paper and

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:39,520
pen. So maybe the school can do during the year some exam for training the students to continue to

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:49,280
write. I see, but for the students you talked before, you know some studies

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,680
spoke about it raises anxiety and reduces self-esteem. We could have issues of

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:07,120
addictivity of students. Many students use computer technology six to eight hours

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,280
a day. It's enough and we don't have to use it in classroom.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:25,680
Maybe the school can organize a sensibilization of students to show the limits of technology.

20
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:40,800
Maybe they can show that the students can also read books and don't usually use technology

21
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:55,600
and also show the limit of time screen. For example, the nights when the students go to

22
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:18,000
sleep if they don't use technology. I see your purpose, but the final point I want to

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,520
talk about is technology is very expensive. A lot of schools

24
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,360
do not have many income and technology is very expensive. How do you do with that?

25
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:52,320
I think the students that can pay for their computer can buy their own computer.

26
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:08,480
I think the school has to prepare a budget before and I don't have a real solution for the money.

27
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:24,800
I think maybe for the school who can not invest in a computer they have to keep the traditional

28
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:37,280
paper and pen. I saw your purpose and why it's interesting. I'm ready to act to use

29
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,240
interactive whiteboard in classroom. Is it interesting the whiteboard or not?

30
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:56,800
Yes, I think it's a good idea because the students can participate with this.

31
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:11,920
Okay, so it's okay. We can show the supervisor to buy some interactive whiteboard.
