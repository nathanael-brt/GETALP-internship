00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Your candidate number?

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
05.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
Your candidate number is 005.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
005, and I'm role A.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
And I'm candidate 025, and I'm role B.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Okay, you can begin.

00:18.000 --> 00:26.000
So I personally think that new technologies aren't any good in class,

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
and it should be something that is out of the school and not in the school.

00:33.000 --> 00:43.000
Okay, I understand your point of view, but today the technology is quite important

00:43.000 --> 00:52.000
because we need computer to access to websites or things like this,

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
and teachers need to show things to the class or things like this.

01:02.000 --> 01:11.000
Yes, of course, I hear this, but I think that there are some studies that show that

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
there are two kinds of situations, I think.

01:18.000 --> 01:29.000
There is when there are everyday new technologies, and it can represent a distraction.

01:29.000 --> 01:38.000
And of course, on the other side, there can be like once a week a class with computer

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
to learn new technologies to the student.

01:42.000 --> 01:52.000
I agree, but I think that the foundation priorities should be the development of new way

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
with new technologies to learn and to teach for the kids.

02:01.000 --> 02:11.000
It's a better way to learn because they are more happy to be there.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
They enjoy the class.

02:15.000 --> 02:25.000
And for the teachers, it's more simple because they can use a lot of things

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
and diversify how they work.

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
Yes, but we know for quite a time now that the amount of time that teens,

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
so students, pass on a device, like a smartphone, computer,

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
is a huge amount of time, like six to eight hours a day.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.000
So we do not need to increase this time.

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
I agree with you, but technology is also a keyboard

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
or the things that can project an image on the keyboard.

03:15.000 --> 03:24.000
And it's not just a computer, so if we invest in the research of new technology,

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
we may discover the new way.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.000
We do not need to be on a computer or iPad or something like this,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
but we can be a technology and help the teacher.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
This is a good point, Moni.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
If we want a new technology in class, this should be with great equipment, like you said,

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
not necessarily a computer per student,

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
but there will be some investment that we need to do.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
And of course, there will be maybe instruction of teachers

04:06.000 --> 04:16.000
because not all teachers know how to use a keyboard or computer for their course,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
for mathematics, for example.

04:19.000 --> 04:26.000
And so there is maybe inequality between a school that has the money for this

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
and a school that doesn't have.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
I know that, and actually it doesn't really concern us.

04:35.000 --> 04:42.000
It's the government who has to help this school and this teacher,

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
and also the parents because maybe the child is in a great school,

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
but he may have no money.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
But it's the government who has to help the school,

05:00.000 --> 05:10.000
and we should offer them the opportunity to buy new stuff.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I agree with you.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
So if the government says that you will invest in this

05:17.000 --> 05:26.000
and of course give money to a school that doesn't have that much money,

05:26.000 --> 05:33.000
I can eventually think that some technology on a certain level

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
with a minimum amount of time can be good

05:40.000 --> 05:48.000
because of course this is not all bad.

05:48.000 --> 05:57.000
Okay, but maybe we should just talk about this with the government

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
for communication and try to see what we can do.

06:02.000 --> 06:10.000
But I think that even if we don't know what the government was going to say,

06:10.000 --> 06:20.000
we know that we have to invest on new technology because it's too important.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
Yes, but we have to invest, but to invest we need to have money

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
and to make sure that some people like government or other kind of people

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
will help and will do everything they can

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
so there isn't any inequality between school and between students

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
because this is the future of the country.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
So if some kids don't have the same education as others,

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
this will increase inequality.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
The government will choose to invest.

07:06.000 --> 07:20.000
It's an evidence because there is too many...

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
He knows he has to do it because the school needs this for work

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
and work in a good way because we saw that the child

07:33.000 --> 07:47.000
and the teacher are happiest in the school when there is more technology.

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation,

07:55.000 --> 08:03.000
technology can be slowly integrated in the classroom,

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
but with regulation, like I said, not every day, like once a week for example,

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
to start or like one hour a day or something like this.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
Yes, I agree with you because we all know that the screen is bad for everyone,

08:22.000 --> 08:32.000
and it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you say.

08:32.000 --> 08:41.000
So the teachers do this part, they have to adapt with the things that we offer to them.

08:41.000 --> 08:50.000
So we just have to agree with the fact that we invest and that's it.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
Yes, so I agree with you.
