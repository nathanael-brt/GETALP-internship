5680	6880	Hello, colleague
6880	8080	Good morning
8080	10080	Ah, this is
10960	14800	We were asked to make suggestion to the supervisor
16160	18160	about the foundation prior it is
19200	22880	I'm actually really in favor to develop technologies
22880	24480	I'm not really
25200	28480	Well for me is like it's a tool
29040	32640	It's used in everyday life as a professional
32640	36400	or professionals use technologies every day
37040	40880	So we need to teach the students how to use it
40880	43920	in order for them to succeed in their professional life
43920	45520	Yeah, I agree with you but
46800	49760	You know some students are poor
49760	50560	Yeah
50560	53840	And some professionals are rich because they have a job
53840	55360	and they have a life, they have a family
56080	59600	And sometimes the students
61120	64560	even where they are immigrants
64560	65600	for example
65600	69440	they don't have any money to buy a computer
69440	74400	and it's difficult for those people to use computer at school
74400	75600	Yeah, I agree with you
75600	77840	That's why the school need to provide them
77840	80800	with computer and technology material
80800	82000	It's just school to provide them
82000	84160	such as the school provides books
84160	84960	For example
84960	88720	Yes, but books are less expensive than computers
88720	94160	School can't buy all computers for all students
94160	96640	Well, it is great because it's in investments
96640	101200	Like book needs to be changed every two or three years
101200	105280	and you have to buy like a way like a wide range of books
105280	108640	for every materials and for all the students
108640	110240	whereas when you have the computer
110240	114160	you only buy one computer and you have all the material on one computer
114160	118160	and it's used not for one student but for a lot of them
118160	123200	And if there is some degradation on the computer what you do
123200	129840	if some students break it or don't take care of a computer
129840	133680	what you do you change it and it's more expensive
133680	135760	that change your book
135760	138560	Well, it's more expensive but when students
138560	141520	degrades books they need to repay for it
141520	146560	so if they degrades the computer they will need to repay it
146560	152720	Yes, but repay a computer is too expensive for students
152720	156160	look at some manifestation in the streets
156160	160480	where students are poor
160480	164000	ask for money, ask for money for by food
164000	172480	for by an invitation and it's not possible for a student to buy a computer
172480	174240	as they want
174240	178640	Well, maybe if the computer says that school is safer for the material
178640	180320	like if they don't bring it at home
180320	182880	they only use it inside the school
182880	186080	maybe they are less risk to break it
186080	191760	So you want to make a mix like at school computer
191760	194640	and at home books
194640	199040	Yeah, so for me like using technology is really important
199040	202080	and to develop like creativity and safe learning
202080	206080	because it's more an intuitive way to learn
206080	210160	than just writing books and memorizing information
210160	216720	and so it's more like the learning to make projects to do research
216720	220240	and stuff like that so we give them more trust
220240	224000	and there are more ability for them to learn
224000	232160	Yes, but some studies show that we learn better with a book
232160	237280	while we're reading that while we're typing or we're searching on the internet
237280	244320	So it's more difficult for students to learn by a computer
244320	248000	than if they really read a book
248320	250560	I disagree with you about that
250560	252800	it might be true about writing
252800	255440	whereas typing on the computer
255440	258960	but actually when you search the information yourself
258960	261440	you'll like more interested in the task
261440	265040	so you will retain the information better
265040	269520	Yes, but you can also sell the information in the book
269520	272640	and you can write it by your hand
272640	275840	and it will be better for your memory
275920	278560	by my personal experience
278560	283680	I know that to learn something I had to read it, I had to learn it
283680	290640	and if I only type it on the computer I come to go to exam and succeed
290640	294880	Yeah, school is not only about learning information
294880	297120	in order to put it in the exam
297120	301920	it's also about learning how to search, how to make projects
302000	306400	how to create something and how to research the information
306400	311840	in order to learn more or to develop some competence
311840	318480	So for that I think the technology is the right tools and not books
318480	327040	I agree but look, for example, we are in Africa but in Africa
327040	329840	they can't have a book already
329840	337120	and if we want to reorganize the school system
337120	342160	that means that some people that can't buy a book
342160	346400	have to buy a computer, it's impossible
346400	350800	Yeah, of course we need to put finances into our budget
350800	352720	to finance all these projects
352720	353680	And you think...
353680	357920	And of course education comes first before technology
358000	363040	So in Africa, education even if it starts with book
363040	369280	and then can involve with technology is more important
369280	372480	but if we want them to really succeed
372480	374800	they need to learn how to use all the tools
374800	377600	they're going to use in their professional life
377600	384480	That's why for me we need to increase our technology teaching
384560	388000	but for that the teachers need to be formed as well
388000	392000	they cannot just put the child in front of the computer
392000	395840	and let them do their thing, they need to guide them
395840	401120	and that way we are not in the system where the teacher is on the shelf
401120	403600	and like the students are behind him
403600	407600	but it's more cooperative when the teacher only guides them
407600	411920	and the students are all safe learning or self-creating
412000	415440	Yes, but you have to buy computers
415440	420080	you have to teach how to use computers
420080	427920	you have to say at some teacher that are old
427920	438800	that are learning all of those teachers are not able to use computers
438800	442240	because they learn school with books
442240	445120	they are learning school with writing at the hand
445120	449280	so that's mean that we need to teach everything
449280	455760	and I think it's a little bit complicated in one second
455760	458560	so I argue with you with all what you said
458560	461840	but we have to make a transition
461840	467440	not to stop all of book and to pass all of computers
467440	469760	yeah, not what I said
469760	476560	actually we just need to increase the work in the teaching we do with technologies
476560	480320	and the age of the teacher doesn't matter
480320	483760	actually teachers need to be formed
483760	488400	because science is always evolving for example
488400	491280	we're not saying that the earth is flat nowadays
491280	496080	so teachers always have to learn in order to teach
496080	505040	and if the teachers learn about technology the age of the teacher really doesn't matter
505040	511120	so for me it's really important and education is always about teaching and learning
511120	514000	where has your students or a teacher
514000	519280	I agree with you so we can make some agreement
519280	522560	yeah maybe just increase like technology class
522800	524800	a little bit not too much
524800	528160	because it's dangerous for for economic of family
528160	530960	for economic of school it's a
530960	536080	it's an investment yes say the future it will go back
536080	537840	i agree with you it's more benefits
537840	540000	it's transition not too fast
540000	542000	okay we can go with the transition
542000	542720	okay perfect
