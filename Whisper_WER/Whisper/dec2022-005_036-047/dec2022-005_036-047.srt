00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,880
Hello, colleague

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,080
Good morning

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
Ah, this is

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,800
We were asked to make suggestion to the supervisor

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,160
about the foundation prior it is

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,880
I'm actually really in favor to develop technologies

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,480
I'm not really

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,480
Well for me is like it's a tool

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,640
It's used in everyday life as a professional

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,400
or professionals use technologies every day

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,880
So we need to teach the students how to use it

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,920
in order for them to succeed in their professional life

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,520
Yeah, I agree with you but

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,760
You know some students are poor

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,560
Yeah

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,840
And some professionals are rich because they have a job

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
and they have a life, they have a family

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,600
And sometimes the students

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,560
even where they are immigrants

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,600
for example

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,440
they don't have any money to buy a computer

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,400
and it's difficult for those people to use computer at school

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,600
Yeah, I agree with you

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,840
That's why the school need to provide them

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,800
with computer and technology material

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,000
It's just school to provide them

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,160
such as the school provides books

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,960
For example

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,720
Yes, but books are less expensive than computers

32
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,160
School can't buy all computers for all students

33
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,640
Well, it is great because it's in investments

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,200
Like book needs to be changed every two or three years

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,280
and you have to buy like a way like a wide range of books

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,640
for every materials and for all the students

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,240
whereas when you have the computer

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,160
you only buy one computer and you have all the material on one computer

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,160
and it's used not for one student but for a lot of them

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,200
And if there is some degradation on the computer what you do

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,840
if some students break it or don't take care of a computer

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
what you do you change it and it's more expensive

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,760
that change your book

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,560
Well, it's more expensive but when students

45
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
degrades books they need to repay for it

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,560
so if they degrades the computer they will need to repay it

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,720
Yes, but repay a computer is too expensive for students

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,160
look at some manifestation in the streets

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,480
where students are poor

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,000
ask for money, ask for money for by food

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,480
for by an invitation and it's not possible for a student to buy a computer

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,240
as they want

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Well, maybe if the computer says that school is safer for the material

54
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,320
like if they don't bring it at home

55
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,880
they only use it inside the school

56
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,080
maybe they are less risk to break it

57
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,760
So you want to make a mix like at school computer

58
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,640
and at home books

59
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,040
Yeah, so for me like using technology is really important

60
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,080
and to develop like creativity and safe learning

61
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,080
because it's more an intuitive way to learn

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,160
than just writing books and memorizing information

63
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,720
and so it's more like the learning to make projects to do research

64
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,240
and stuff like that so we give them more trust

65
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,000
and there are more ability for them to learn

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,160
Yes, but some studies show that we learn better with a book

67
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,280
while we're reading that while we're typing or we're searching on the internet

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,320
So it's more difficult for students to learn by a computer

69
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,000
than if they really read a book

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,560
I disagree with you about that

71
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,800
it might be true about writing

72
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,440
whereas typing on the computer

73
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,960
but actually when you search the information yourself

74
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,440
you'll like more interested in the task

75
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,040
so you will retain the information better

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,520
Yes, but you can also sell the information in the book

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,640
and you can write it by your hand

78
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,840
and it will be better for your memory

79
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,560
by my personal experience

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,680
I know that to learn something I had to read it, I had to learn it

81
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,640
and if I only type it on the computer I come to go to exam and succeed

82
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,880
Yeah, school is not only about learning information

83
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,120
in order to put it in the exam

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,920
it's also about learning how to search, how to make projects

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,400
how to create something and how to research the information

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,840
in order to learn more or to develop some competence

87
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,480
So for that I think the technology is the right tools and not books

88
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:27,040
I agree but look, for example, we are in Africa but in Africa

89
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,840
they can't have a book already

90
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,120
and if we want to reorganize the school system

91
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,160
that means that some people that can't buy a book

92
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,400
have to buy a computer, it's impossible

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,800
Yeah, of course we need to put finances into our budget

94
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
to finance all these projects

95
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,680
And you think...

96
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,920
And of course education comes first before technology

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,040
So in Africa, education even if it starts with book

98
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,280
and then can involve with technology is more important

99
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,480
but if we want them to really succeed

100
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,800
they need to learn how to use all the tools

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
they're going to use in their professional life

102
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,480
That's why for me we need to increase our technology teaching

103
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,000
but for that the teachers need to be formed as well

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
they cannot just put the child in front of the computer

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,840
and let them do their thing, they need to guide them

106
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,120
and that way we are not in the system where the teacher is on the shelf

107
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,600
and like the students are behind him

108
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,600
but it's more cooperative when the teacher only guides them

109
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,920
and the students are all safe learning or self-creating

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,440
Yes, but you have to buy computers

111
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,080
you have to teach how to use computers

112
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,920
you have to say at some teacher that are old

113
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:18,800
that are learning all of those teachers are not able to use computers

114
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
because they learn school with books

115
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,120
they are learning school with writing at the hand

116
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,280
so that's mean that we need to teach everything

117
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,760
and I think it's a little bit complicated in one second

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,560
so I argue with you with all what you said

119
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,840
but we have to make a transition

120
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,440
not to stop all of book and to pass all of computers

121
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,760
yeah, not what I said

122
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,560
actually we just need to increase the work in the teaching we do with technologies

123
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,320
and the age of the teacher doesn't matter

124
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,760
actually teachers need to be formed

125
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,400
because science is always evolving for example

126
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,280
we're not saying that the earth is flat nowadays

127
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,080
so teachers always have to learn in order to teach

128
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:25,040
and if the teachers learn about technology the age of the teacher really doesn't matter

129
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:31,120
so for me it's really important and education is always about teaching and learning

130
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,000
where has your students or a teacher

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,280
I agree with you so we can make some agreement

132
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,560
yeah maybe just increase like technology class

133
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
a little bit not too much

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,160
because it's dangerous for for economic of family

135
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,960
for economic of school it's a

136
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,080
it's an investment yes say the future it will go back

137
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,840
i agree with you it's more benefits

138
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,000
it's transition not too fast

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
okay we can go with the transition

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,720
okay perfect
