0	3000	Yes, zero, one, seven.
3000	5000	Can you roll?
5000	7000	A roll, eight.
7000	8000	And yours please?
8000	11000	Zero, two, nine, and a whole bit.
11000	14000	Okay, when you're ready, you guys can begin.
14000	16000	You have eight minutes to ten minutes.
16000	18000	And this means you have one minute left.
18000	19000	Okay.
19000	21000	You can begin now.
21000	23000	You start.
23000	24000	Two.
24000	26000	How's your heart?
26000	27000	Okay.
27000	34000	I'm going to defend the fact that the school should remodelate the use of the technology
34000	42000	in the classroom, because there's a lot of negative points about it.
42000	51000	Like, it's not a good thing to be in-screen all day for a child, because it can develop
51000	60000	and anxiety and the child can become and go more usually.
60000	66000	And they're not very concentrated when they're on a screen.
66000	71400	No one can really watch what they're doing in front of the screen, so it can develop
71400	78400	a possible arsement, so it's why it should be in-moderate.
78400	87400	I personally think that have technology in classes, it's a new perspective of teaching,
87400	96400	and it enables students to be curious and search information online on topics they like.
96400	104400	And also, ecologically speaking, it's good for environment, because we don't have to use paper.
104400	111400	So I think it's quite good.
111400	122400	Well, what about the motivation of the use, because of the cyber arsement that can be made of?
122400	125400	I'm listening to your point.
125400	135400	I think it has this topic of technology in classes as pros and cons,
135400	140400	and your telling and cons that is arsement.
140400	152400	But I think that things could be put to avoid arsement.
152400	157400	I don't have solutions.
157400	167400	But don't you think that people must not be very concentrated when they're not in front of the screen?
167400	172400	You know what I mean? When the teacher is speaking in a traditional way,
172400	180400	that you will think, okay, let's not be concentrated now and be concentrated on the screen because it's fun.
180400	193400	I have mixed feelings about that, because I think that technology can allow children or students and teachers
193400	200400	to have a dialogue, another dialogue from the classics school.
200400	211400	I think also that now with the development of data, it's more practical.
211400	221400	To search online things than in books.
221400	231400	And how about the...
231400	233400	Oh, I don't know.
233400	246400	What about the anxiety, the anger, and all the negative points that the studies show of the screen?
246400	256400	Don't you think that a low children at home is usually on the screen, come to class?
256400	260400	Also, a screen is a good thing for the development of the side.
260400	267400	I don't know, but it's a road to do a certain...
267400	270400	How do you say?
271400	275400	You can follow the line.
275400	287400	I think it's great to have technology in school and at home because for children,
287400	297400	it's more practical and for teachers.
297400	303400	It's a new perspective to teach and it's interesting for them.
303400	312400	But what about the people who are not very...
312400	322400	Well, we don't really use the teacher, we don't really use the screen or everything.
322400	329400	And when you ask them to teach with the things that they didn't know how to use it.
329400	330400	Yes.
330400	348400	The fact is that teachers in their childhood, in the last decade, weren't happy to use technology because it didn't exist.
348400	359400	But the thing is that they can now be coached and they can learn to...
359400	360400	Learn to...
360400	365400	No, I don't know how to proceed.
371400	376400	So we can find a compromise, a compromise, yes.
377400	387400	I listen to what you are saying and I think that the screen is a good thing but it should be moderated.
387400	399400	It's not a no for me to be used at school but it should be moderated because of everything that is the consequence of the using of the screen.
399400	400400	Yes.
400400	401400	I totally agree with you.
401400	408400	And I think one or two hours per day or per week, it's a good thing.
408400	409400	Yeah.
409400	410400	And not no more.
410400	411400	Yes.
411400	413400	It should be a...
413400	417400	The traditional way should be used.
417400	418400	Yes.
418400	420400	And not only on the screen.
420400	421400	Yeah.
421400	423400	Both are perfect.
