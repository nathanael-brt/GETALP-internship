0	4360	can we do that zero, three, nine, a row, eight?
4360	5160	Thank you.
5160	8880	I'm going to do it zero, four, zero, I'm the world bee.
8880	10160	Okay, thank you very much.
10160	11160	You guys can begin.
12840	13840	Okay.
13840	18840	So I think that we should introduce technology
21720	24760	to the classrooms and to the students.
24760	28360	I think it would be great since we live now in a world
28360	30720	where technology is everywhere.
30720	33160	I think our students are going to have
33160	36360	to experience some jobs that we don't know yet
36360	39680	that even probably doesn't don't exist yet.
39680	43440	So I think that we really have to make them familiar
43440	46280	with technology, with computers,
46280	49720	and with using them in their daily life.
49720	50760	So what do you think?
50760	55440	Yes, but don't you think that the children's
55440	59320	only use technology at school isn't too much
59320	63520	and they have to continue to write with their hands
63520	66920	and don't only use the new technology?
66920	70360	I don't think that we have to make them use
70360	73640	only technology, making them use it doesn't mean
73640	77880	that they won't be writing or anything besides,
77880	79440	they don't have to do it all the time.
79440	82800	Because I think that they have to continue writing
83480	88480	because the jobs that use the right will continue.
90120	94440	So I think it would be great to moderate
94440	97800	between new technology and like whole school.
97800	101240	Yes, we could, but I also think that using technology
101240	105760	is very important because we are facing a new generation,
105760	110520	a new world with new ways to learn.
110520	114600	And I think that we should adapt the school system to this.
114600	116560	It could increase their autonomy.
116560	119600	With more dialogue, the professor won't be there
119600	123640	just to stand here and talk and the students
123640	125200	won't be passive anymore.
125200	128520	I think it's important for them to learn them,
128520	133520	to be active, more active, and to increase their autonomy.
133520	137600	Yeah, but there is a problem that scientists proved
137600	142600	that and like therapist proved that use technology at school,
144000	147760	even children's use technology out from school.
147760	151480	So they use art school, out from school,
151480	154840	and it developed the anxiety for example,
154840	159840	and it can develop depression if they don't have access
160400	161600	to the technology.
161600	163560	So I think they get,
164560	172560	we have to make a balance between school and not school.
172560	176560	So we can make different classes, for example,
176560	180560	like if the parents want because they,
180560	184560	this is their choice when children are young
184560	186560	and make different class.
186560	188560	Yes, I think that's interesting.
188560	191560	And I agree with you, they use screens
191560	194560	and internet and computers all the time.
194560	197560	It's a generation who was born with this
197560	199560	and who knows it may be better than us.
199560	203560	And I think that we should learn them how to make good things
203560	210560	and to use these computers and all these screens
210560	211560	usefully.
211560	216560	We have to learn them how to make it good,
216560	220560	how to do good things with it, how to use them
220560	225560	and use them to help them,
225560	229560	like even in the work at work at school,
229560	234560	because now the children are using these screens
234560	239560	and everything mostly to do not to work
239560	242560	to divertissement and everything.
242560	245560	So I think it's important to learn them how to work with it
245560	247560	and how to make it useful.
247560	251560	But I don't think that for little parts,
251560	254560	yes, they will use it correctly,
254560	259560	but most of the children will want to go on Netflix
259560	263560	on YouTube and it's going to be a distraction
263560	267560	more than a real surprise.
267560	271560	Yeah, I think this is why the teachers are important
271560	273560	and this is why they are here
273560	278560	and they have to be well trained to involve to the children
278560	281560	the value of it that they have a chance
281560	290560	to have these computers and this technology.
290560	294560	And I think that if we learn them how to use them correctly
294560	297560	and not only for Netflix and everything
297560	299560	and playing games and everything,
299560	302560	I think that it can only be great.
302560	308560	They will know how to make it great.
308560	313560	Yeah, but if you make a teacher,
313560	317560	make the transition and use technology
317560	321560	and if the teacher doesn't want to use it,
321560	323560	he will not use it correctly.
323560	327560	And I think it's just a transition
327560	330560	of what he knows before
330560	333560	and just with technology.
333560	337560	So it's not necessary useful.
337560	343560	Yeah, this is why we have to put a lot of financial resources
343560	346560	on this project to form correctly the teachers
346560	349560	so they actually know what to do
349560	353560	and not just do what they usually did on a computer
353560	355560	because this is nonsense,
355560	357560	this is not useful at all.
357560	360560	We have to train the teacher well
360560	363560	so they can transmit to the children the right thing
363560	365560	what we want them to do.
365560	369560	But who is going to pay for all this equipment?
369560	372560	The school are the parents
372560	376560	because it represents huge depends.
376560	381560	So not everyone can do it for all their children.
381560	384560	It represents a big difficulty.
384560	387560	This is how I think we should have a discussion
387560	393560	with the state and big associations
393560	398560	and everything to be allowed to afford it
398560	401560	and to offer everyone the same changes
401560	404560	to use technology usefully.
404560	409560	Yes, and I think it's not possible
409560	412560	in a crisis, if there is a one,
412560	415560	like actually in Ukraine,
415560	419560	there is a repercussion in every country.
419560	424560	If we, in France, we want to do this
424560	426560	to put the technology at school,
426560	431560	the state cannot finance for any.
431560	437560	So you have to go back and use the old technical.
437560	440560	So I think it's not certain.
440560	442560	You cannot, for the moment, use it
442560	444560	because it's too expensive.
444560	447560	Teachers are still old.
447560	450560	Maybe next generations
450560	453560	because they were born with this,
453560	456560	maybe they will use it correctly.
456560	459560	But I think for the moment it's not possible.
459560	462560	Well, I think it's something that will take a long time.
462560	466560	Of course, we cannot do it in a few years
466560	469560	and just it's not that fast.
469560	470560	It cannot be that fast.
470560	473560	But I think that on the long term,
473560	475560	we will be able to do this.
475560	477560	Of course, it will take a bit of time,
477560	479560	but this is now we have to start it.
479560	481560	Okay, so it's going to be a transition.
481560	482560	Yeah.
482560	485560	Yeah, so maybe what we can do is
485560	489560	for a certain class trying to use it.
489560	491560	Yeah, to test.
491560	492560	Yeah, to test, like test.
492560	496560	And if it's beneficial or not,
496560	499560	maybe we will introduce it
499560	501560	for the new generations.
501560	504560	Of course, but it has to be well done.
504560	505560	Yeah.
505560	507560	And we don't have to discriminate any children.
507560	509560	We can test all the few classes.
509560	511560	But as it works when it's well done,
511560	518560	I think we should now start to think about finance this in priority.
518560	519560	Because I think this is the future.
519560	520560	Yeah.
520560	524560	We have a generation that was born with this technology
524560	527560	and we have to adapt with it.
527560	529560	So maybe, I don't know, maybe,
529560	532560	abandon all the systems progressively
532560	535560	to, at the end,
535560	540560	to end up with this technology system being the main one.
540560	544560	And if it doesn't work
544560	546560	for the new generations,
546560	554560	is it not depends that we could evitate
554560	558560	and, for example,
558560	561560	use this money that we used for children
561560	563560	who doesn't have the chance to learn,
563560	566560	like in some certain poor country,
566560	570560	rather than use it for our school,
570560	572560	that we have...
572560	574560	I think we're speaking of our country
574560	577560	in that right now in our country,
577560	580560	mostly pretty much everyone has the change to go to school
580560	581560	and to learn.
581560	584560	So this is now we have to try new things.
584560	588560	Maybe to help the poorest people
588560	590560	so they can have it later.
590560	592560	Of course, it's going to be difficult.
592560	596560	But we can't know if we just spend money
596560	598560	on something that won't work.
598560	602560	If we don't try, we cannot know if it's going to work or not.
602560	603560	Yeah.
603560	605560	If we don't try.
605560	607560	There is a problem.
607560	610560	If there is connection problem in a class,
610560	613560	the teacher cannot make his class.
613560	615560	For example, you know,
615560	619560	there is a risk that you don't have
619560	622560	with a traditional way of learning.
622560	624560	Yes, it can happen, of course.
624560	628560	I think this is why we should put some experts
628560	631560	on every school that could be able to
631560	634560	make any intervention at any moment
634560	637560	to solve the problem if it exists.
637560	641560	This is why I told you it has to be well organized.
641560	644560	If it's done just not...
644560	647560	If we don't put enough energy in it, it won't work.
647560	650560	This is why we have to put a lot of money right now
650560	652560	so it works well.
652560	655560	And then we're going to maybe be able
655560	658560	to have this technology system that will work
658560	661560	and it's going to be beneficial for everyone.
661560	665560	Yeah, but I still think it's not a good idea
665560	669560	because you lose the...
669560	672560	you do have the discussion with the teacher,
672560	674560	you don't have the...
674560	677560	you will lose all your...
677560	681560	your abilities to go and have a discussion
681560	684560	with another people except behind the computer.
684560	686560	In the...
686560	690560	when you're going to work in your professional life,
690560	693560	you will have to discuss with, for example,
693560	696560	a client if you go in commercial way.
696560	700560	So I think you have to...
700560	703560	to use technology because, yeah,
703560	706560	I agree it's important for our generation.
706560	708560	So 100%.
708560	712560	But we have to stay with the traditional way.
712560	713560	Yeah, I agree.
713560	718560	We have to keep nourishing the relationship between people.
718560	722560	We don't have to be like...
722560	725560	present and...
725560	727560	under the computer and everything.
727560	728560	Yes, you're right.
728560	731560	We have to make a dialogue, a discussion
731560	735560	between the teacher that will be here to help the children
735560	737560	not only to learn them like magically,
737560	740560	just to discuss with them.
740560	741560	Yeah.
741560	743560	To increase the autonomy of the children
743560	747560	and their capacity to communicate with each other.
747560	748560	Okay.
