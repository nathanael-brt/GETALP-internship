00:00.000 --> 00:04.360
can we do that zero, three, nine, a row, eight?

00:04.360 --> 00:05.160
Thank you.

00:05.160 --> 00:08.880
I'm going to do it zero, four, zero, I'm the world bee.

00:08.880 --> 00:10.160
Okay, thank you very much.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.160
You guys can begin.

00:12.840 --> 00:13.840
Okay.

00:13.840 --> 00:18.840
So I think that we should introduce technology

00:21.720 --> 00:24.760
to the classrooms and to the students.

00:24.760 --> 00:28.360
I think it would be great since we live now in a world

00:28.360 --> 00:30.720
where technology is everywhere.

00:30.720 --> 00:33.160
I think our students are going to have

00:33.160 --> 00:36.360
to experience some jobs that we don't know yet

00:36.360 --> 00:39.680
that even probably doesn't don't exist yet.

00:39.680 --> 00:43.440
So I think that we really have to make them familiar

00:43.440 --> 00:46.280
with technology, with computers,

00:46.280 --> 00:49.720
and with using them in their daily life.

00:49.720 --> 00:50.760
So what do you think?

00:50.760 --> 00:55.440
Yes, but don't you think that the children's

00:55.440 --> 00:59.320
only use technology at school isn't too much

00:59.320 --> 01:03.520
and they have to continue to write with their hands

01:03.520 --> 01:06.920
and don't only use the new technology?

01:06.920 --> 01:10.360
I don't think that we have to make them use

01:10.360 --> 01:13.640
only technology, making them use it doesn't mean

01:13.640 --> 01:17.880
that they won't be writing or anything besides,

01:17.880 --> 01:19.440
they don't have to do it all the time.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.800
Because I think that they have to continue writing

01:23.480 --> 01:28.480
because the jobs that use the right will continue.

01:30.120 --> 01:34.440
So I think it would be great to moderate

01:34.440 --> 01:37.800
between new technology and like whole school.

01:37.800 --> 01:41.240
Yes, we could, but I also think that using technology

01:41.240 --> 01:45.760
is very important because we are facing a new generation,

01:45.760 --> 01:50.520
a new world with new ways to learn.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.600
And I think that we should adapt the school system to this.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.560
It could increase their autonomy.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.600
With more dialogue, the professor won't be there

01:59.600 --> 02:03.640
just to stand here and talk and the students

02:03.640 --> 02:05.200
won't be passive anymore.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.520
I think it's important for them to learn them,

02:08.520 --> 02:13.520
to be active, more active, and to increase their autonomy.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.600
Yeah, but there is a problem that scientists proved

02:17.600 --> 02:22.600
that and like therapist proved that use technology at school,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.760
even children's use technology out from school.

02:27.760 --> 02:31.480
So they use art school, out from school,

02:31.480 --> 02:34.840
and it developed the anxiety for example,

02:34.840 --> 02:39.840
and it can develop depression if they don't have access

02:40.400 --> 02:41.600
to the technology.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.560
So I think they get,

02:44.560 --> 02:52.560
we have to make a balance between school and not school.

02:52.560 --> 02:56.560
So we can make different classes, for example,

02:56.560 --> 03:00.560
like if the parents want because they,

03:00.560 --> 03:04.560
this is their choice when children are young

03:04.560 --> 03:06.560
and make different class.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.560
Yes, I think that's interesting.

03:08.560 --> 03:11.560
And I agree with you, they use screens

03:11.560 --> 03:14.560
and internet and computers all the time.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.560
It's a generation who was born with this

03:17.560 --> 03:19.560
and who knows it may be better than us.

03:19.560 --> 03:23.560
And I think that we should learn them how to make good things

03:23.560 --> 03:30.560
and to use these computers and all these screens

03:30.560 --> 03:31.560
usefully.

03:31.560 --> 03:36.560
We have to learn them how to make it good,

03:36.560 --> 03:40.560
how to do good things with it, how to use them

03:40.560 --> 03:45.560
and use them to help them,

03:45.560 --> 03:49.560
like even in the work at work at school,

03:49.560 --> 03:54.560
because now the children are using these screens

03:54.560 --> 03:59.560
and everything mostly to do not to work

03:59.560 --> 04:02.560
to divertissement and everything.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.560
So I think it's important to learn them how to work with it

04:05.560 --> 04:07.560
and how to make it useful.

04:07.560 --> 04:11.560
But I don't think that for little parts,

04:11.560 --> 04:14.560
yes, they will use it correctly,

04:14.560 --> 04:19.560
but most of the children will want to go on Netflix

04:19.560 --> 04:23.560
on YouTube and it's going to be a distraction

04:23.560 --> 04:27.560
more than a real surprise.

04:27.560 --> 04:31.560
Yeah, I think this is why the teachers are important

04:31.560 --> 04:33.560
and this is why they are here

04:33.560 --> 04:38.560
and they have to be well trained to involve to the children

04:38.560 --> 04:41.560
the value of it that they have a chance

04:41.560 --> 04:50.560
to have these computers and this technology.

04:50.560 --> 04:54.560
And I think that if we learn them how to use them correctly

04:54.560 --> 04:57.560
and not only for Netflix and everything

04:57.560 --> 04:59.560
and playing games and everything,

04:59.560 --> 05:02.560
I think that it can only be great.

05:02.560 --> 05:08.560
They will know how to make it great.

05:08.560 --> 05:13.560
Yeah, but if you make a teacher,

05:13.560 --> 05:17.560
make the transition and use technology

05:17.560 --> 05:21.560
and if the teacher doesn't want to use it,

05:21.560 --> 05:23.560
he will not use it correctly.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.560
And I think it's just a transition

05:27.560 --> 05:30.560
of what he knows before

05:30.560 --> 05:33.560
and just with technology.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.560
So it's not necessary useful.

05:37.560 --> 05:43.560
Yeah, this is why we have to put a lot of financial resources

05:43.560 --> 05:46.560
on this project to form correctly the teachers

05:46.560 --> 05:49.560
so they actually know what to do

05:49.560 --> 05:53.560
and not just do what they usually did on a computer

05:53.560 --> 05:55.560
because this is nonsense,

05:55.560 --> 05:57.560
this is not useful at all.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.560
We have to train the teacher well

06:00.560 --> 06:03.560
so they can transmit to the children the right thing

06:03.560 --> 06:05.560
what we want them to do.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.560
But who is going to pay for all this equipment?

06:09.560 --> 06:12.560
The school are the parents

06:12.560 --> 06:16.560
because it represents huge depends.

06:16.560 --> 06:21.560
So not everyone can do it for all their children.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.560
It represents a big difficulty.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.560
This is how I think we should have a discussion

06:27.560 --> 06:33.560
with the state and big associations

06:33.560 --> 06:38.560
and everything to be allowed to afford it

06:38.560 --> 06:41.560
and to offer everyone the same changes

06:41.560 --> 06:44.560
to use technology usefully.

06:44.560 --> 06:49.560
Yes, and I think it's not possible

06:49.560 --> 06:52.560
in a crisis, if there is a one,

06:52.560 --> 06:55.560
like actually in Ukraine,

06:55.560 --> 06:59.560
there is a repercussion in every country.

06:59.560 --> 07:04.560
If we, in France, we want to do this

07:04.560 --> 07:06.560
to put the technology at school,

07:06.560 --> 07:11.560
the state cannot finance for any.

07:11.560 --> 07:17.560
So you have to go back and use the old technical.

07:17.560 --> 07:20.560
So I think it's not certain.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.560
You cannot, for the moment, use it

07:22.560 --> 07:24.560
because it's too expensive.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.560
Teachers are still old.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.560
Maybe next generations

07:30.560 --> 07:33.560
because they were born with this,

07:33.560 --> 07:36.560
maybe they will use it correctly.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.560
But I think for the moment it's not possible.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.560
Well, I think it's something that will take a long time.

07:42.560 --> 07:46.560
Of course, we cannot do it in a few years

07:46.560 --> 07:49.560
and just it's not that fast.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.560
It cannot be that fast.

07:50.560 --> 07:53.560
But I think that on the long term,

07:53.560 --> 07:55.560
we will be able to do this.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.560
Of course, it will take a bit of time,

07:57.560 --> 07:59.560
but this is now we have to start it.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.560
Okay, so it's going to be a transition.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.560
Yeah.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.560
Yeah, so maybe what we can do is

08:05.560 --> 08:09.560
for a certain class trying to use it.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.560
Yeah, to test.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.560
Yeah, to test, like test.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.560
And if it's beneficial or not,

08:16.560 --> 08:19.560
maybe we will introduce it

08:19.560 --> 08:21.560
for the new generations.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.560
Of course, but it has to be well done.

08:24.560 --> 08:25.560
Yeah.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.560
And we don't have to discriminate any children.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.560
We can test all the few classes.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.560
But as it works when it's well done,

08:31.560 --> 08:38.560
I think we should now start to think about finance this in priority.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.560
Because I think this is the future.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.560
Yeah.

08:40.560 --> 08:44.560
We have a generation that was born with this technology

08:44.560 --> 08:47.560
and we have to adapt with it.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.560
So maybe, I don't know, maybe,

08:49.560 --> 08:52.560
abandon all the systems progressively

08:52.560 --> 08:55.560
to, at the end,

08:55.560 --> 09:00.560
to end up with this technology system being the main one.

09:00.560 --> 09:04.560
And if it doesn't work

09:04.560 --> 09:06.560
for the new generations,

09:06.560 --> 09:14.560
is it not depends that we could evitate

09:14.560 --> 09:18.560
and, for example,

09:18.560 --> 09:21.560
use this money that we used for children

09:21.560 --> 09:23.560
who doesn't have the chance to learn,

09:23.560 --> 09:26.560
like in some certain poor country,

09:26.560 --> 09:30.560
rather than use it for our school,

09:30.560 --> 09:32.560
that we have...

09:32.560 --> 09:34.560
I think we're speaking of our country

09:34.560 --> 09:37.560
in that right now in our country,

09:37.560 --> 09:40.560
mostly pretty much everyone has the change to go to school

09:40.560 --> 09:41.560
and to learn.

09:41.560 --> 09:44.560
So this is now we have to try new things.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.560
Maybe to help the poorest people

09:48.560 --> 09:50.560
so they can have it later.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.560
Of course, it's going to be difficult.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.560
But we can't know if we just spend money

09:56.560 --> 09:58.560
on something that won't work.

09:58.560 --> 10:02.560
If we don't try, we cannot know if it's going to work or not.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.560
Yeah.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.560
If we don't try.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.560
There is a problem.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.560
If there is connection problem in a class,

10:10.560 --> 10:13.560
the teacher cannot make his class.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.560
For example, you know,

10:15.560 --> 10:19.560
there is a risk that you don't have

10:19.560 --> 10:22.560
with a traditional way of learning.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.560
Yes, it can happen, of course.

10:24.560 --> 10:28.560
I think this is why we should put some experts

10:28.560 --> 10:31.560
on every school that could be able to

10:31.560 --> 10:34.560
make any intervention at any moment

10:34.560 --> 10:37.560
to solve the problem if it exists.

10:37.560 --> 10:41.560
This is why I told you it has to be well organized.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.560
If it's done just not...

10:44.560 --> 10:47.560
If we don't put enough energy in it, it won't work.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.560
This is why we have to put a lot of money right now

10:50.560 --> 10:52.560
so it works well.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.560
And then we're going to maybe be able

10:55.560 --> 10:58.560
to have this technology system that will work

10:58.560 --> 11:01.560
and it's going to be beneficial for everyone.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.560
Yeah, but I still think it's not a good idea

11:05.560 --> 11:09.560
because you lose the...

11:09.560 --> 11:12.560
you do have the discussion with the teacher,

11:12.560 --> 11:14.560
you don't have the...

11:14.560 --> 11:17.560
you will lose all your...

11:17.560 --> 11:21.560
your abilities to go and have a discussion

11:21.560 --> 11:24.560
with another people except behind the computer.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.560
In the...

11:26.560 --> 11:30.560
when you're going to work in your professional life,

11:30.560 --> 11:33.560
you will have to discuss with, for example,

11:33.560 --> 11:36.560
a client if you go in commercial way.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.560
So I think you have to...

11:40.560 --> 11:43.560
to use technology because, yeah,

11:43.560 --> 11:46.560
I agree it's important for our generation.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.560
So 100%.

11:48.560 --> 11:52.560
But we have to stay with the traditional way.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.560
Yeah, I agree.

11:53.560 --> 11:58.560
We have to keep nourishing the relationship between people.

11:58.560 --> 12:02.560
We don't have to be like...

12:02.560 --> 12:05.560
present and...

12:05.560 --> 12:07.560
under the computer and everything.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.560
Yes, you're right.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.560
We have to make a dialogue, a discussion

12:11.560 --> 12:15.560
between the teacher that will be here to help the children

12:15.560 --> 12:17.560
not only to learn them like magically,

12:17.560 --> 12:20.560
just to discuss with them.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.560
Yeah.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.560
To increase the autonomy of the children

12:23.560 --> 12:27.560
and their capacity to communicate with each other.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.560
Okay.
