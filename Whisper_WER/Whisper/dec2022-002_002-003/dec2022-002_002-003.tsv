0	4000	So I'm candidat002 and I'm the role A.
4000	8000	And I'm the candidat003 and the role B.
14000	18000	Well, hello, when you say, I don't know your name, I'm sorry.
18000	20000	I'm John. I'm you.
20000	22000	I'm Carol.
22000	24000	Okay, nice to meet you.
24000	29000	We are talking today about the tactile duty on the classroom.
29000	31000	Yeah.
31000	33000	What do you think about?
33000	36000	Well, I'm pro-technology, I could say.
36000	39000	I believe we should implement technology more in the classroom,
39000	47000	but of course implement your regulations to make sure that the students learn from technology,
47000	51000	but not with it, and to make sure that their school experience is the best.
51000	58000	Okay, I have absolutely any problem with the fact that students can learn with technologies.
58000	64000	But there's I think some aspects which are dangerous, such as bullying.
64000	76000	And for that, I think that we need to put in place a kind of system of control of the informatic tools.
76000	81000	And it has to be encoderated by the teachers,
81000	85000	when students are using it. What do you think about?
85000	91000	Well, the bullying is one of the risks that is really evident with social media,
91000	94000	and the fact that students are using it more and more,
94000	97000	and that their parents are having problems regulating it,
97000	100000	because they don't really understand their principle.
100000	108000	So that is why we could also try and implement strict rules regarding their devices.
108000	114000	Like an example was given of the fact that some teachers at the beginning of their classes
114000	117000	used to ask questions and students,
117000	121000	and it would be easier for students to answer the forums online,
121000	126000	and to make sure that those forums are only parts of the school website, for example,
126000	129000	and that are used by everyone,
129000	133000	and of course strict regulation regarding maybe course words,
133000	137000	and make sure that they are filters, etc.
137000	144000	Yeah, and I think that they should also verify the history of the,
144000	148000	for example, the computers or all the devices,
148000	151000	which were used by the students.
151000	153000	It has to be moderated.
153000	161000	They don't have, I think, that they don't have to stay all day behind a screen,
162000	167000	and it has to be only used in an educated way, for example,
167000	170000	for homework, for researchers, something like that,
170000	176000	and absolutely in any case, for personal uses.
179000	184000	It's a very interesting idea, but it's dangerous if it's not well done.
184000	187000	Yeah, I remember teacher, sixth grade teacher,
187000	192000	if I remember, of the Fisher Middle School localizing you from the UK
192000	194000	that said in her classes,
194000	200000	she used around one hour of her time for the students to go online,
200000	202000	to use the screens, etc.
202000	206000	And I was a little bit surprised and unfounded,
206000	211000	unfounded to find that, because I think it's a little bit too much.
211000	216000	So we should implement rules regarding the hours,
216000	219000	make sure they don't spend too much time,
219000	223000	and that the screens they are on doesn't replace the students.
223000	228000	Yeah, but we can also make a kind of open space,
228000	232000	or co-working space in this school,
232000	238000	and where there will be some technological devices,
238000	244000	which can be used every time of the day,
245000	250000	and could pay me to the students to work as they want,
250000	256000	with some teachers around who could look at what they are doing,
256000	260000	if it's in a link or not with the school,
260000	267000	and maybe put in place a system of card that they had to insert
267000	274000	in a kind of box,
274000	278000	which will vary five if they have already used in the day,
278000	285000	a computer, and making some, as you say, filters,
285000	289000	and reducing the time of use per day,
289000	293000	for example, to maximum one hour.
293000	297000	Yeah, that's a really interesting idea, John.
297000	300000	It's still a good idea, because it's still a combination
300000	303000	of normal, traditional ways of learning,
303000	304000	and also screens.
304000	308000	Like some said, a teacher said that she used Kagan structures,
308000	312000	which is a form of cooperative learning moment,
312000	315000	and also because they had little book clubs,
315000	320000	so they would use computers and tablets to learn a little bit more,
320000	323000	but they also had things outside of screens
323000	327000	by interacting with others and learning at the same time.
327000	332000	Yeah, and also there's not only computers or screens,
332000	338000	there's also the book club in which Kagan continued to learn
338000	344000	and to check all the information that they need for their works,
344000	356000	and also I was thinking about a sensibilization of the students,
356000	365000	but also the teachers of the schools about the impact psychologically,
365000	371000	and also physically, for example, the eye and the health.
371000	378000	And I think that this system of co-working space
378000	387000	with some informatic devices will permit to avoid the social
387000	395000	and economical fracture that there is between them,
395000	400000	as it was said, in an article between the white colors
400000	410000	and the black colors due to their origins and their lifestyle,
410000	417000	because many people who are of black skin color
417000	421000	don't have informatic devices for work.
421000	425000	Well, yeah, currently technology is a bit of a working problem in progress.
425000	430000	Like we said, the technology has a real tool on mental health,
430000	434000	with anxiety, low self esteem, sometimes depression,
434000	437000	and yeah, some are more advantage,
437000	440000	because their parents, for example, have high incomes,
440000	443000	compared to others that don't really have access to computers
443000	446000	because their parents get afford to.
446000	451000	So, like I said before, try and regulate and also help
451000	457000	by funding schools so that each student can be able to access computers in school.
457000	460000	And I think we should do that also,
460000	463000	because we have a lot of learning to do,
463000	468000	but also learning techniques are present with technology.
468000	473000	Like this topic of constructivism,
473000	475000	an inquiry-based learning, for example,
475000	479000	where students are taught to search for topics in themselves,
480000	483000	and teachers are there to guide them.
483000	486000	And you can help with independence,
486000	489000	constructing a train of thoughts,
489000	493000	answering questions and understanding instructions.
493000	498000	Yeah, so I absolutely agree with all that you said.
498000	502000	I think that the thing that we have to put in place
502000	507000	is to moderate and control the behavior of the students
507000	512000	and moderate in function of the age of the students.
512000	515000	For example, the first great student
515000	521000	have to use in the maximum half hour per day the computers
521000	524000	and the last year students, for example,
524000	527000	maximum two hours to prepare their exams.
527000	529000	I don't know what you think about.
529000	532000	Well, I think we can both agree that the main,
532000	535000	the foundation, the main priority,
535000	538000	is to ensure that technology is available to everyone,
538000	541000	but also that there are strict rules to make sure
541000	544000	that it doesn't end badly for the students themselves.
544000	546000	Yeah, so you agree with that?
546000	547000	Yeah.
547000	549000	Perfect, thank you.
549000	550000	Thank you.
