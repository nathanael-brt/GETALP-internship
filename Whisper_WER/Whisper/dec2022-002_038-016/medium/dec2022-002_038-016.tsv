0	4000	So, 38, situation 1 and role B.
4000	6000	Yes, the role, sorry.
6000	11000	Number 016, situation 1 and role A.
14000	23000	So, what do you think about the priorities that we can call B in the matter of technology in the classroom?
23000	25000	Do you think it's a good thing?
26000	33000	Because I think, in my opinion, if you include more technology in the classroom,
33000	39000	we are going to increase the knowledge and the skill of the students.
39000	43000	It's a way to discover a new method. What do you think about that?
43000	50000	No, I disagree with you because I think it's more armed than good.
50000	55000	And schools should moderate using technology.
55000	69000	Indeed, social inequalities can be evocated because some students don't have the tools necessary
69000	75000	and don't have access to computers or the internet, for example.
76000	84000	So, I think it's not a good way to admit new technology in the classroom.
84000	92000	Okay, and as you say, some students don't have access to the technology.
92000	103000	And do you think that if we put in class some computers and work just a little time at every class,
103000	107000	they can discover a new thing because they don't have it at their home?
107000	113000	Yes, it's possible, but it's so expensive for the schools.
113000	126000	And the teacher must be formed and it's a major problem to develop new technologies.
127000	134000	It's so expensive for the schools and it increases inequalities.
134000	142000	Yes, I agree with you. It's very expensive and teachers need very good training.
142000	149000	But I think it's a way to increase the curiosity of children and students.
149000	158000	And it may be a way for them to study in a way more exciting and more interesting for them.
158000	162000	So, I think we need to find solutions.
162000	169000	There is not too much, but not at all.
169000	171000	What do you think?
171000	175000	Yes, I agree with you on this point.
175000	185000	But the risk is to disconnect the students with the reality.
185000	196000	And I think it's more better to read a book, for example, than to learn with a computer.
196000	209000	And for example, in some countries, students don't have the possibility to buy good equipment
209000	215000	and access of new technology increases social inequalities.
215000	228000	Yes, but in the real life, when you have a job, a work, you need to know how to use a computer
228000	236000	because a lot of jobs are using computers for grading mail, do some studies.
236000	240000	So, I think it's not good if there is too much.
240000	251000	But they need a little bit every month or every day for increase their knowledge and skills for their future jobs.
251000	256000	So, which solution can we found together?
256000	261000	Yes, a little bit is a possibility.
261000	274000	And students pass exams, pass assessments, and the assessments were written.
274000	282000	So, I think it's possible to make...
282000	286000	Some exercises, maybe, and some research.
286000	288000	Yes, but a little bit.
288000	296000	Yes, and maybe it can be a good idea if they do some research in the Internet
296000	303000	for discovering a computer and how it's working, and maybe some exercises.
303000	307000	But as you say, tests are on a paper with a pen.
307000	312000	So, just a little bit for their curiosity and discovery.
312000	318000	Yes, it's a good way to increase our knowledge.
318000	341000	Yes, and do you think it's a better solution if a teacher decided to do three hours of their courses on the computer
341000	350000	of maybe just an hour per day or three hours per month because they need?
350000	356000	So, I understand that they don't need very much, but not less.
356000	362000	Yes, one hour per day.
362000	365000	It's a good solution, I think.
365000	386000	And it's a good way to increase our capacity, our skills in different topics.
386000	399000	Yes, I think change the way of the learning, not just on the board with exercise paper and books
399000	405000	that can attract students.
405000	411000	They can be more exciting to learning and more interesting on the courses.
411000	420000	Yes, it's very beneficial. Benefits are good in this point.
420000	424000	And as you already said, it's very expensive.
424000	425000	Yes.
425000	438000	So, maybe not a computer for every student, but some computers in the class,
438000	450000	and they can turn during three hours and some don't exercise on their papers and other on their computers.
450000	461000	Yes, and each student can be access to a computer.
461000	464000	Yes.
464000	471000	Can we also learn with a pen and a paper?
471000	485000	Maybe we don't give homework at home on a computer for a variety of inequalities, as you said,
485000	488000	but do some exercises in the school.
488000	496000	In class, yes, in school.
496000	510000	So, I think, like I already said, that school should moderate the using of technology.
510000	518000	And I think your proposition is very good for the students and the teacher.
518000	529000	If I can conclude, maybe we can say that we are going to do many technologies in class,
529000	538000	three hours per day, but with rotations that are going to avoid the inequalities between students,
538000	543000	and they can increase their knowledge and skills.
543000	545000	Am I missing something?
545000	547000	No, it's perfect. Thank you.
