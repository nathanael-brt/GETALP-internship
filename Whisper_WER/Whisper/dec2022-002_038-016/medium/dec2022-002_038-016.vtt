00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
So, 38, situation 1 and role B.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Yes, the role, sorry.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
Number 016, situation 1 and role A.

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
So, what do you think about the priorities that we can call B in the matter of technology in the classroom?

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Do you think it's a good thing?

00:26.000 --> 00:33.000
Because I think, in my opinion, if you include more technology in the classroom,

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
we are going to increase the knowledge and the skill of the students.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
It's a way to discover a new method. What do you think about that?

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
No, I disagree with you because I think it's more armed than good.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
And schools should moderate using technology.

00:55.000 --> 01:09.000
Indeed, social inequalities can be evocated because some students don't have the tools necessary

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
and don't have access to computers or the internet, for example.

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
So, I think it's not a good way to admit new technology in the classroom.

01:24.000 --> 01:32.000
Okay, and as you say, some students don't have access to the technology.

01:32.000 --> 01:43.000
And do you think that if we put in class some computers and work just a little time at every class,

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
they can discover a new thing because they don't have it at their home?

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
Yes, it's possible, but it's so expensive for the schools.

01:53.000 --> 02:06.000
And the teacher must be formed and it's a major problem to develop new technologies.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
It's so expensive for the schools and it increases inequalities.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
Yes, I agree with you. It's very expensive and teachers need very good training.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
But I think it's a way to increase the curiosity of children and students.

02:29.000 --> 02:38.000
And it may be a way for them to study in a way more exciting and more interesting for them.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
So, I think we need to find solutions.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
There is not too much, but not at all.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
What do you think?

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
Yes, I agree with you on this point.

02:55.000 --> 03:05.000
But the risk is to disconnect the students with the reality.

03:05.000 --> 03:16.000
And I think it's more better to read a book, for example, than to learn with a computer.

03:16.000 --> 03:29.000
And for example, in some countries, students don't have the possibility to buy good equipment

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
and access of new technology increases social inequalities.

03:35.000 --> 03:48.000
Yes, but in the real life, when you have a job, a work, you need to know how to use a computer

03:48.000 --> 03:56.000
because a lot of jobs are using computers for grading mail, do some studies.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
So, I think it's not good if there is too much.

04:00.000 --> 04:11.000
But they need a little bit every month or every day for increase their knowledge and skills for their future jobs.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
So, which solution can we found together?

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
Yes, a little bit is a possibility.

04:21.000 --> 04:34.000
And students pass exams, pass assessments, and the assessments were written.

04:34.000 --> 04:42.000
So, I think it's possible to make...

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Some exercises, maybe, and some research.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Yes, but a little bit.

04:48.000 --> 04:56.000
Yes, and maybe it can be a good idea if they do some research in the Internet

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
for discovering a computer and how it's working, and maybe some exercises.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
But as you say, tests are on a paper with a pen.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
So, just a little bit for their curiosity and discovery.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
Yes, it's a good way to increase our knowledge.

05:18.000 --> 05:41.000
Yes, and do you think it's a better solution if a teacher decided to do three hours of their courses on the computer

05:41.000 --> 05:50.000
of maybe just an hour per day or three hours per month because they need?

05:50.000 --> 05:56.000
So, I understand that they don't need very much, but not less.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
Yes, one hour per day.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
It's a good solution, I think.

06:05.000 --> 06:26.000
And it's a good way to increase our capacity, our skills in different topics.

06:26.000 --> 06:39.000
Yes, I think change the way of the learning, not just on the board with exercise paper and books

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
that can attract students.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
They can be more exciting to learning and more interesting on the courses.

06:51.000 --> 07:00.000
Yes, it's very beneficial. Benefits are good in this point.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
And as you already said, it's very expensive.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Yes.

07:05.000 --> 07:18.000
So, maybe not a computer for every student, but some computers in the class,

07:18.000 --> 07:30.000
and they can turn during three hours and some don't exercise on their papers and other on their computers.

07:30.000 --> 07:41.000
Yes, and each student can be access to a computer.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
Yes.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
Can we also learn with a pen and a paper?

07:51.000 --> 08:05.000
Maybe we don't give homework at home on a computer for a variety of inequalities, as you said,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
but do some exercises in the school.

08:08.000 --> 08:16.000
In class, yes, in school.

08:16.000 --> 08:30.000
So, I think, like I already said, that school should moderate the using of technology.

08:30.000 --> 08:38.000
And I think your proposition is very good for the students and the teacher.

08:38.000 --> 08:49.000
If I can conclude, maybe we can say that we are going to do many technologies in class,

08:49.000 --> 08:58.000
three hours per day, but with rotations that are going to avoid the inequalities between students,

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
and they can increase their knowledge and skills.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Am I missing something?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
No, it's perfect. Thank you.
