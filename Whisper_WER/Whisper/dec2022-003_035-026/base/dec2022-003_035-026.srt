1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Oh, three five, Putin is a raison.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
No, oh, three five and roll A.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Roll A.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh, 26 roll B.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay, thank you very much, lady.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You can begin.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You'd like to start?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't care.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, go ahead.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, so we have to talk about new technologies in classroom.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Personally, I think new technologies are too expensive for school.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Between the cost of tools like computer, the cost of, for example, help support.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What do you think of them?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, I agree. It's a bit expensive, but I think we can manage to have state subsidies and runs

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
so that we can buy some devices that can be useful for students.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For example, interactive whiteboards.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They can help some students with difficulties to stay focused.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Especially when students with hard difficulties are encouraged to drop out of school.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Maybe a more technological way to make them learn is easier.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Make it easier for them to learn or to stay focused at school.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know because some students need to be focused and they are more focused on paper, for example.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, I agree.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Technology is also everywhere now and students should be aware of the danger.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So maybe learn how to use it as school from a young age may prevent them from the danger

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and risk to use technologies such as bullying online or being, or people with bad intentions.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I think there are more disparities between students because some students have a computer at home

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and others do not have.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Technology is everywhere, but not really.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Maybe just for students who doesn't have the privilege to have a computer at home.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It could be a good opportunity for them to learn to use a computer at school because if they don't have it at home,

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:01,000
one day they will be in a firm where they will have to use a computer or software and hardware and they will not be able to do it.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So maybe especially for those children who are like technology at home, maybe technology at school could have them improve their skills

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and not be slashed with it when they enter their labor world.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I think the intention is good, but for example, I remember when I was a kid, we had computer in school and we played games during the class.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It triggered the question of the use of technology.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Maybe if we buy a few computers at the beginning and train the teachers on how to use them properly and with good intentions for education

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and only to help the students, maybe in math or computer problems, maybe it could be useful, but they have to be limited under the use.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
IE may be put boundaries on internet connections or websites that it can access.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know exactly how, but I know that we can prevent them from using Facebook, Instagram, etc. or even games on the computers by putting in place a software on it.

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Maybe it's not to the school to learn that, but the parents, for example, Facebook, Instagram, etc.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Especially in school, if we choose to put in place computers, we can make the choice to put boundaries under use so that it could be used in a good way and not in a way unusual.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Do you have something to add? I think it may be for some students.

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know if it's not complicated to be, for example, to learn on computer and after for the test to be on paper.

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Getting balanced between the two, maybe computer can be used for specific subjects, but not all.

45
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And on the subjects, for which they will have a test on paper, only train them on paper and if they will have tests on computer, train them with online tests so that they can train and not be lost.

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I see exam.

47
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And I see therapists think that the use of computers, although they see that students are more...

48
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There is more anxiety, for example.

49
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, I absolutely agree with that part of the matter.

50
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think every opportunity in technology has advantages and disadvantages and we may balance the two so that we can make the best choice for the students and the teachers so that they can manage to teach properly.

51
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Maybe just use the computers for example a few minutes per day and after four hours, but not all the day.

52
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah, I agree. Maybe at the beginning we can implement it only for a few subjects in the week and maybe see how it works on students and how they feel about it.

53
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:13,000
If they have maybe suggestions, we can ask them and the teachers also, if they have specific requirements or needs and we can evolve with this subject.

54
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't know if you agree or disagree.

55
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think maybe for the course schools could have computers with the nation, for example.

56
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, with the state, we will have to find if the state schools grant subsidies to buy them and especially for upkeep and maintenance expenses.

57
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We will have to look out for an assistance, maybe.

58
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But you should have to be careful for the use of the computers.

59
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, but if he is an assistant of technology, maybe he can hit his job.

60
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I mean, hire someone whose job is to take care of computers, you know, as a technical assistant.

61
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Maybe if we hire someone who knows how to keep and maintenance devices, it could cost us less money to replace them or to buy other ones if they just don't work anymore.

62
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Do you have any arguments?

63
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah, just for that, as technology is everywhere, I think it's good to prepare the students for later when they will have to use it in firms or even for example in France.

64
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Because all of taxes and such things must be completed online.

65
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And so, for example, all persons have a lot of difficulties to complete these firms.

66
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So, maybe if the young people learn how to do it younger, maybe they can manage not only to use it by themselves, but to learn other people how to do it or help them.

67
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't know, but even if we learn how to use for example a computer, otherwise it is different, so it's not really the problem.

68
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But as we say earlier, maybe we can start implementing a few computers and with boundaries and see how it evolves.

69
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And if we continue to find technological education or not, if you agree.

70
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I think it's important to make provision.

71
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

72
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Prevention is key.
