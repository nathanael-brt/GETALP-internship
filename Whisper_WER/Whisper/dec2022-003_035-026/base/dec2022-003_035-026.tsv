0	3000	Oh, three five, Putin is a raison.
3000	6000	No, oh, three five and roll A.
6000	8000	Roll A.
8000	11000	Oh, 26 roll B.
11000	13000	Okay, thank you very much, lady.
13000	15000	You can begin.
15000	17000	You'd like to start?
17000	19000	I don't care.
19000	21000	Yeah, go ahead.
21000	27000	Okay, so we have to talk about new technologies in classroom.
27000	33000	Personally, I think new technologies are too expensive for school.
33000	39000	Between the cost of tools like computer, the cost of, for example, help support.
39000	41000	What do you think of them?
41000	48000	Yeah, I agree. It's a bit expensive, but I think we can manage to have state subsidies and runs
48000	56000	so that we can buy some devices that can be useful for students.
56000	60000	For example, interactive whiteboards.
60000	65000	They can help some students with difficulties to stay focused.
65000	70000	Especially when students with hard difficulties are encouraged to drop out of school.
70000	78000	Maybe a more technological way to make them learn is easier.
78000	83000	Make it easier for them to learn or to stay focused at school.
83000	94000	I don't know because some students need to be focused and they are more focused on paper, for example.
94000	97000	Yeah, I agree.
97000	108000	Technology is also everywhere now and students should be aware of the danger.
108000	116000	So maybe learn how to use it as school from a young age may prevent them from the danger
116000	134000	and risk to use technologies such as bullying online or being, or people with bad intentions.
134000	143000	I think there are more disparities between students because some students have a computer at home
143000	147000	and others do not have.
147000	152000	Technology is everywhere, but not really.
152000	158000	Maybe just for students who doesn't have the privilege to have a computer at home.
158000	169000	It could be a good opportunity for them to learn to use a computer at school because if they don't have it at home,
169000	181000	one day they will be in a firm where they will have to use a computer or software and hardware and they will not be able to do it.
181000	193000	So maybe especially for those children who are like technology at home, maybe technology at school could have them improve their skills
193000	204000	and not be slashed with it when they enter their labor world.
204000	216000	I think the intention is good, but for example, I remember when I was a kid, we had computer in school and we played games during the class.
216000	220000	It triggered the question of the use of technology.
220000	236000	Maybe if we buy a few computers at the beginning and train the teachers on how to use them properly and with good intentions for education
236000	253000	and only to help the students, maybe in math or computer problems, maybe it could be useful, but they have to be limited under the use.
253000	260000	IE may be put boundaries on internet connections or websites that it can access.
260000	277000	I don't know exactly how, but I know that we can prevent them from using Facebook, Instagram, etc. or even games on the computers by putting in place a software on it.
277000	285000	Maybe it's not to the school to learn that, but the parents, for example, Facebook, Instagram, etc.
285000	306000	Especially in school, if we choose to put in place computers, we can make the choice to put boundaries under use so that it could be used in a good way and not in a way unusual.
306000	313000	Do you have something to add? I think it may be for some students.
313000	321000	I don't know if it's not complicated to be, for example, to learn on computer and after for the test to be on paper.
321000	330000	Getting balanced between the two, maybe computer can be used for specific subjects, but not all.
330000	348000	And on the subjects, for which they will have a test on paper, only train them on paper and if they will have tests on computer, train them with online tests so that they can train and not be lost.
348000	351000	I see exam.
351000	363000	And I see therapists think that the use of computers, although they see that students are more...
363000	366000	There is more anxiety, for example.
366000	371000	Yeah, I absolutely agree with that part of the matter.
371000	389000	I think every opportunity in technology has advantages and disadvantages and we may balance the two so that we can make the best choice for the students and the teachers so that they can manage to teach properly.
389000	398000	Maybe just use the computers for example a few minutes per day and after four hours, but not all the day.
398000	413000	Yeah, I agree. Maybe at the beginning we can implement it only for a few subjects in the week and maybe see how it works on students and how they feel about it.
413000	433000	If they have maybe suggestions, we can ask them and the teachers also, if they have specific requirements or needs and we can evolve with this subject.
433000	439000	I don't know if you agree or disagree.
439000	445000	I think maybe for the course schools could have computers with the nation, for example.
445000	459000	Yeah, with the state, we will have to find if the state schools grant subsidies to buy them and especially for upkeep and maintenance expenses.
459000	465000	We will have to look out for an assistance, maybe.
465000	478000	But you should have to be careful for the use of the computers.
478000	485000	Yeah, but if he is an assistant of technology, maybe he can hit his job.
485000	496000	I mean, hire someone whose job is to take care of computers, you know, as a technical assistant.
496000	523000	Maybe if we hire someone who knows how to keep and maintenance devices, it could cost us less money to replace them or to buy other ones if they just don't work anymore.
523000	525000	Do you have any arguments?
525000	546000	Yeah, just for that, as technology is everywhere, I think it's good to prepare the students for later when they will have to use it in firms or even for example in France.
546000	553000	Because all of taxes and such things must be completed online.
553000	562000	And so, for example, all persons have a lot of difficulties to complete these firms.
562000	578000	So, maybe if the young people learn how to do it younger, maybe they can manage not only to use it by themselves, but to learn other people how to do it or help them.
578000	590000	I don't know, but even if we learn how to use for example a computer, otherwise it is different, so it's not really the problem.
590000	599000	But as we say earlier, maybe we can start implementing a few computers and with boundaries and see how it evolves.
599000	606000	And if we continue to find technological education or not, if you agree.
606000	609000	And I think it's important to make provision.
609000	610000	Yeah, yeah.
610000	612000	Prevention is key.
