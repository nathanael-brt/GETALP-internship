00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
035, Pauline Sarrazin.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
No, 035 and your?

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
And role A.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Role A.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
026, role B.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Okay, thank you very much, ladies.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
You can begin.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
You would like to start?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
I don't care.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah, go ahead.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Okay, so we have to talk about new technologies in the classroom.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Personally, I think new technologies are too expensive for school,

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
between the cost of tools like computer, the cost of, for example, help support.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
What do you think about that?

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
Yeah, I agree, it's a bit expensive, but I think we can manage to have state subsidies and grants

00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
so that we can buy some devices that can be useful for students.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
For example, interactive voice boards that can help some students with difficulties to stay focused,

01:03.000 --> 01:09.000
especially among students with high difficulties or in virtue to drop out of school.

01:09.000 --> 01:17.000
Maybe a more technological way to make them learn is more easier,

01:17.000 --> 01:22.000
make it easier for them to learn or to stay focused at school.

01:22.000 --> 01:31.000
I don't know, because some students need to be focused and they are more focused on paper, for example.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah, I agree.

01:34.000 --> 01:47.000
Yeah, but technology is also everywhere now, and so students should be aware of the danger,

01:47.000 --> 01:58.000
so maybe learn how to use it at school from a young age may prevent them from the danger and risk to use technologies,

01:58.000 --> 02:14.000
such as bullying online or people with bad intentions.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
Okay, but I think there are more disparities between students because some students have, for example, a computer at home

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
and other students do not have, so yeah, technology is everywhere, but not really...

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah, but maybe just for students who don't have the privilege to have a computer at home,

02:38.000 --> 02:48.000
it could be a good opportunity for them to learn to use a computer at school because if they don't have it at home,

02:48.000 --> 03:01.000
one day they will be in a firm where they will have to use a computer or software and hardware and they will not be able to do it.

03:01.000 --> 03:12.000
So maybe, especially for those children who lack technology at home, maybe technology at school could help them improve their skills

03:12.000 --> 03:23.000
and not be slashed with it when they enter the labor world.

03:24.000 --> 03:35.000
Okay, I think the intention is good, but for example, I remember when I was a kid, we had computers at school and we played games during the class.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Yeah, it triggered the question of the use of technology.

03:40.000 --> 03:51.000
Maybe if we buy a few computers at the beginning and train the teachers on how to use them properly

03:51.000 --> 04:04.000
and with good intentions for education and only to help the students maybe in math or computer problems,

04:04.000 --> 04:19.000
maybe it could be useful, but they have to be limited on the use, i.e. maybe put boundaries on internet connections or a website that they can access.

04:19.000 --> 04:36.000
I don't know exactly how, but I know that we can prevent them from using Facebook, Instagram, etc. or even games on their computers by putting in place a software on it.

04:36.000 --> 04:44.000
But maybe it's not to the school to learn that, but the parents, for example, Facebook, Instagram, etc.

04:44.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah, but especially at school, if we choose to put in place computers, we can make this choice to put boundaries on the use so that it could be used in a good way and not in a way unuseful.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Okay, I see.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Do you have something to add?

05:08.000 --> 05:23.000
I think maybe for some students, I don't know if it's not complicated for them to learn on computer and after for the test to be on paper and you see the imbalance between the two.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
Maybe computer can be used for specific subjects, but not all.

05:30.000 --> 05:38.000
And on the subjects for which they will have a test on paper, only train them on paper.

05:38.000 --> 05:50.000
And if they will have tests on computer, train them with online tests so that they can train and not be lost at the exam.

05:50.000 --> 06:05.000
And I see therapists think that the use of computers, although they see that students are more, there is more anxiety, for example.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
Yeah, I agree with that part of the matter.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
I think every opportunity in technology has advantages and disadvantages.

06:18.000 --> 06:29.000
And we may balance the two so that we can make the best choice for the students and the teachers so that they can manage to teach properly.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Maybe just use the computers, for example, a few minutes per day.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
And after four hours, but not all the day.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

06:39.000 --> 06:53.000
Maybe at the beginning we can implement it only for a few subjects in the week and maybe see how it works on students and how they feel about it.

06:53.000 --> 07:04.000
If they have maybe suggestions, we can we can ask them and the teachers also if they have specific requirements or needs.

07:04.000 --> 07:12.000
And we can evolve with this subject.

07:12.000 --> 07:19.000
I don't know if you agree or disagree.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
I think maybe for the cost schools could have computers with the nation, for example.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah, with the state.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, we will have to to find if the states could grant us subsidies to buy them.

07:33.000 --> 07:45.000
And especially for upkeep and maintenance expenses, we will have to look out for an assistant, maybe.

07:45.000 --> 07:58.000
But you should have to be careful for the use of the computers.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. But if he is an assistant of technology, maybe he can hit his job.

08:05.000 --> 08:16.000
I mean, hire someone whose job is to take care of computers, you know, as a technological assistance, technical assistance.

08:16.000 --> 08:43.000
Maybe if we hire someone who knows how to to upkeep and maintenance devices, it could cost us less money to replace them or to buy other ones if they just don't work anymore.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Do you have any arguments?

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
Yeah.

08:51.000 --> 09:13.000
Just for that, as technology is everywhere, I think it's good to prepare the students for later when they will have to use it in firms or even for example, in France, all of taxes and such things must be completed online.

09:13.000 --> 09:22.000
And so, for example, all persons have a lot of difficulties to complete these forms.

09:22.000 --> 09:38.000
So maybe if the young people learned how to do it younger, maybe they can manage to not only to to use it by themselves, but to learn other people how to do it or help them.

09:38.000 --> 09:45.000
I don't know, but even if we learn how to use, for example, a computer, otherwise said, I different.

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
So it's not really the problem.

09:50.000 --> 09:59.000
But as we say earlier, maybe we can start implementing a few computers and with boundaries and see how it evolves.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
And if we continue to found technological education or not, if you agree.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
And I think it's important to make prevention.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Yeah.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Prevention is key.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah, OK.
