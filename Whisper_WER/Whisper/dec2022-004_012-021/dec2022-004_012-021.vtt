00:00.000 --> 00:19.560
I'd like to say that the use of technology in the classroom is not always good, it can

00:19.560 --> 00:24.400
bring a lot of harm to students and also to the school as well.

00:24.400 --> 00:30.560
First of all, I'd like to say it's expensive to implement, you need to buy the goods like computers

00:30.560 --> 00:38.240
and boards, and also the equipment that you need to maintain the computers.

00:38.240 --> 00:50.120
Yeah, but I think that is the role of the states, the states need to pay for all of it because

00:50.120 --> 01:02.160
it's his job to provide to all students to have the equipment required for good learning and

01:02.160 --> 01:03.520
good teaching.

01:03.520 --> 01:09.840
Indeed, it could be the role of the state to provide, but you have also to take an account

01:09.840 --> 01:14.400
of the fact that teachers need to be trained, which also costs money and time away from

01:14.400 --> 01:21.400
the students who could benefit of a more traditional way of education, so where would

01:21.400 --> 01:22.840
that money come from?

01:22.840 --> 01:31.000
Yes, but to my mind, the new teachers will bring the new 21st century children, so they

01:31.000 --> 01:39.680
will grow up with the new technology, so we will need to teach them less than actually

01:39.680 --> 01:42.320
with the old teacher.

01:42.320 --> 01:48.600
So don't you think that progressively the teacher won't be needed and it could lead to unemployment?

01:48.600 --> 01:54.720
If their children are able to study without teachers and just using technology, maybe

01:54.720 --> 02:00.760
one day it will go too far and we will lose the profession that is teaching?

02:00.760 --> 02:06.000
No, because I'm not saying that robots can replace teachers.

02:06.000 --> 02:15.320
I just think that the technology, sorry, is a tool for teachers to help the students

02:15.320 --> 02:21.920
or the child to make more research.

02:21.920 --> 02:34.640
It's a tool that they can use, for example, to go far away from their, from what they

02:34.640 --> 02:35.640
know.

02:35.640 --> 02:41.760
The teacher can not know everything, so when, for example, they work on the project

02:41.760 --> 02:49.560
or something, they can use the technology to help them to work, to reach new methods

02:49.560 --> 02:51.680
of working, of teaching.

02:51.680 --> 02:57.600
In fact, this is a good argument, but I think that we should also take account in account

02:57.600 --> 03:06.240
that technology at school could have a negative impact on the student life as far for the

03:06.240 --> 03:13.560
screen time, because technology is present everywhere, so at home also, and if there is

03:13.560 --> 03:22.600
no break between use at home and at school, it can lead to addiction and problems like anxiety.

03:22.600 --> 03:30.160
Yes, I agree, but that is our work, that is a teacher work and parents work.

03:30.160 --> 03:37.440
We need to control the time that the child spent on the screen, for example.

03:37.440 --> 03:45.560
We can work only two hours a day on screen, sorry, screens at school, and the parents

03:45.560 --> 03:51.360
can control the times when the child will come back at home.

03:51.360 --> 03:58.080
So the child will not spend too much time on the screen, and we can do like exercise,

03:58.080 --> 04:04.920
like who seems like feedback, to talk about what did you see on screen, what did you

04:04.920 --> 04:13.280
think to make, to share together with the children, to have their feelings about the screen,

04:13.280 --> 04:18.400
and to check if they are good with it.

04:18.400 --> 04:25.240
So what I hear you say is that the traditional way of teaching is still needed, and therefore

04:25.240 --> 04:30.320
it also shows that technology has maybe not spread in a classroom, if you still need

04:30.320 --> 04:34.240
the balance between traditional teaching and technology.

04:34.240 --> 04:41.080
So I think technology can be useful, but you also have to take account that not everyone

04:41.080 --> 04:46.800
has access to it, and if maybe we start using it, then we have to homework to do with

04:46.800 --> 04:52.400
it, and researches, and some students don't have access to that because of low income.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.240
That keeps them disadvantaged them.

04:54.240 --> 05:04.160
That's why I think that the state's best pay for it, because I think, for example, the

05:04.160 --> 05:09.920
states can buy computers or some adversities for the school.

05:09.920 --> 05:15.040
The school we rented to the students, so they will have all the same computers, all the

05:15.040 --> 05:22.920
same advices, so they will be not, like I say, disparities, I can say it like this,

05:22.920 --> 05:25.000
disparities between them.

05:25.000 --> 05:37.280
It will be easier for the teacher because they will have all the same computers or adversities,

05:37.280 --> 05:44.920
and they will not be disparities because they will work, they will be equal, I see.

05:45.120 --> 05:51.720
But I also hear that it's a very expensive project, like I said, to buy the computers, to

05:51.720 --> 05:56.920
keep the maintenance up, everything.

05:56.920 --> 06:04.280
I don't think every school, every state has the money for that in every school, and more

06:04.280 --> 06:05.280
over.

06:05.280 --> 06:09.520
When maintenance is needed, you can't use the technology, so you can also slow down

06:09.520 --> 06:12.800
the learning process while it's in maintenance.

06:12.800 --> 06:13.800
Could you repeat?

06:14.440 --> 06:22.160
While computers, technology devices are in maintenance, they can't be used, so it slows

06:22.160 --> 06:24.160
down the learning process.

06:24.160 --> 06:29.560
Not, because to my mind, the learning process is not based on technology, it's just a

06:29.560 --> 06:38.200
tool that they can use to help them, it's not the majority of the works, so it will not

06:38.200 --> 06:46.800
be like something missing when they are in maintenance, you understand.

06:46.800 --> 06:54.120
The teacher will work with, like you said, traditional methods, but they can use the technology

06:54.120 --> 07:01.840
to help them to bring new methods, to adapt their methods to students which are maybe

07:01.840 --> 07:10.040
different, maybe who wants to discover something, different, because they have a different

07:10.040 --> 07:11.840
level, for example.

07:11.840 --> 07:20.760
What about exams, because when you learn to take on a computer or to work on a computer

07:20.760 --> 07:29.120
and then you find yourself in front of a sheet and a traditional way of writing exams,

07:29.120 --> 07:33.480
if you students may be lost, because they are not that used to it.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.600
To my mind, it depends of the skills.

07:37.600 --> 07:43.600
For example, if in class they used to work mathematics without a computer, they should

07:43.600 --> 07:52.160
do the exam without the computer, but if they work something like a French with the

07:52.160 --> 07:56.280
computers, they will pass the exam with the computers, too.

07:56.280 --> 08:00.280
Like this, they will have the habits.

08:00.280 --> 08:09.240
I hear you, and I feel like we can go to a compromise where we think that technology can

08:09.240 --> 08:15.520
be used, but with limits and work that in the schools with the teacher who need a lot

08:15.520 --> 08:16.520
of training.

08:16.520 --> 08:23.160
Exactly, like I said, the technology will not be the base of the teaching, it will be just

08:23.160 --> 08:28.040
a plus tools that can be used by the teacher to help the children.
