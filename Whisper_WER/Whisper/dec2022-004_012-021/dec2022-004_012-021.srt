1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,560
I'd like to say that the use of technology in the classroom is not always good, it can

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,400
bring a lot of harm to students and also to the school as well.

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,560
First of all, I'd like to say it's expensive to implement, you need to buy the goods like computers

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,240
and boards, and also the equipment that you need to maintain the computers.

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:50,120
Yeah, but I think that is the role of the states, the states need to pay for all of it because

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:01:02,160
it's his job to provide to all students to have the equipment required for good learning and

7
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,520
good teaching.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,840
Indeed, it could be the role of the state to provide, but you have also to take an account

9
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,400
of the fact that teachers need to be trained, which also costs money and time away from

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,400
the students who could benefit of a more traditional way of education, so where would

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,840
that money come from?

12
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes, but to my mind, the new teachers will bring the new 21st century children, so they

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,680
will grow up with the new technology, so we will need to teach them less than actually

14
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,320
with the old teacher.

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,600
So don't you think that progressively the teacher won't be needed and it could lead to unemployment?

16
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,720
If their children are able to study without teachers and just using technology, maybe

17
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,760
one day it will go too far and we will lose the profession that is teaching?

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,000
No, because I'm not saying that robots can replace teachers.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,320
I just think that the technology, sorry, is a tool for teachers to help the students

20
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,920
or the child to make more research.

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:34,640
It's a tool that they can use, for example, to go far away from their, from what they

22
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
know.

23
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,760
The teacher can not know everything, so when, for example, they work on the project

24
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,560
or something, they can use the technology to help them to work, to reach new methods

25
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,680
of working, of teaching.

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,600
In fact, this is a good argument, but I think that we should also take account in account

27
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:06,240
that technology at school could have a negative impact on the student life as far for the

28
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,560
screen time, because technology is present everywhere, so at home also, and if there is

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:22,600
no break between use at home and at school, it can lead to addiction and problems like anxiety.

30
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:30,160
Yes, I agree, but that is our work, that is a teacher work and parents work.

31
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:37,440
We need to control the time that the child spent on the screen, for example.

32
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,560
We can work only two hours a day on screen, sorry, screens at school, and the parents

33
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,360
can control the times when the child will come back at home.

34
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,080
So the child will not spend too much time on the screen, and we can do like exercise,

35
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,920
like who seems like feedback, to talk about what did you see on screen, what did you

36
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:13,280
think to make, to share together with the children, to have their feelings about the screen,

37
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,400
and to check if they are good with it.

38
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,240
So what I hear you say is that the traditional way of teaching is still needed, and therefore

39
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,320
it also shows that technology has maybe not spread in a classroom, if you still need

40
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,240
the balance between traditional teaching and technology.

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,080
So I think technology can be useful, but you also have to take account that not everyone

42
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,800
has access to it, and if maybe we start using it, then we have to homework to do with

43
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,400
it, and researches, and some students don't have access to that because of low income.

44
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,240
That keeps them disadvantaged them.

45
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:04,160
That's why I think that the state's best pay for it, because I think, for example, the

46
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,920
states can buy computers or some adversities for the school.

47
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,040
The school we rented to the students, so they will have all the same computers, all the

48
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:22,920
same advices, so they will be not, like I say, disparities, I can say it like this,

49
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,000
disparities between them.

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:37,280
It will be easier for the teacher because they will have all the same computers or adversities,

51
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,920
and they will not be disparities because they will work, they will be equal, I see.

52
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,720
But I also hear that it's a very expensive project, like I said, to buy the computers, to

53
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,920
keep the maintenance up, everything.

54
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:04,280
I don't think every school, every state has the money for that in every school, and more

55
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
over.

56
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,520
When maintenance is needed, you can't use the technology, so you can also slow down

57
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,800
the learning process while it's in maintenance.

58
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Could you repeat?

59
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:22,160
While computers, technology devices are in maintenance, they can't be used, so it slows

60
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
down the learning process.

61
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,560
Not, because to my mind, the learning process is not based on technology, it's just a

62
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:38,200
tool that they can use to help them, it's not the majority of the works, so it will not

63
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:46,800
be like something missing when they are in maintenance, you understand.

64
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,120
The teacher will work with, like you said, traditional methods, but they can use the technology

65
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,840
to help them to bring new methods, to adapt their methods to students which are maybe

66
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:10,040
different, maybe who wants to discover something, different, because they have a different

67
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,840
level, for example.

68
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:20,760
What about exams, because when you learn to take on a computer or to work on a computer

69
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:29,120
and then you find yourself in front of a sheet and a traditional way of writing exams,

70
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,480
if you students may be lost, because they are not that used to it.

71
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,600
To my mind, it depends of the skills.

72
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,600
For example, if in class they used to work mathematics without a computer, they should

73
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:52,160
do the exam without the computer, but if they work something like a French with the

74
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,280
computers, they will pass the exam with the computers, too.

75
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Like this, they will have the habits.

76
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:09,240
I hear you, and I feel like we can go to a compromise where we think that technology can

77
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,520
be used, but with limits and work that in the schools with the teacher who need a lot

78
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
of training.

79
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:23,160
Exactly, like I said, the technology will not be the base of the teaching, it will be just

80
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,040
a plus tools that can be used by the teacher to help the children.
