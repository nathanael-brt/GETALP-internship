00:00.000 --> 00:19.120
I think technology is the future, but she has a many many problems because the students

00:19.120 --> 00:29.200
are already exposed to this technology out of the school, so that's why I think we should

00:29.200 --> 00:49.360
moderate that use and maybe we can put a

00:49.360 --> 01:05.120
plage of of of hours still for example one hour for today and after we continue the

01:05.120 --> 01:19.280
traditional way exercise like papers and books and I agree with you to

01:20.240 --> 01:32.800
keep using books papers and traditional way of learning but in my opinion technology

01:32.800 --> 01:45.040
provides extensive opportunities for students it's a way for them to develop new skills and their

01:45.040 --> 02:05.120
creativity by using devices like tablets, computers etc and it's a new way of learning for them

02:05.120 --> 02:23.440
it can develop their interest for what we we are studying and like you said they already use

02:24.400 --> 02:45.200
electronic devices so developing learning by technology is really in our area and that's why I think

02:45.200 --> 02:54.960
we should develop that point in the school yes but what do you think about the psychology of our

02:54.960 --> 03:05.200
students if we expose too much our students to technology we know that it's a possibility for them

03:05.200 --> 03:15.920
to develop anxiety and I think that can degrade their their relationships so I think we have

03:15.920 --> 03:28.240
to take this in consideration and maybe don't put them really faster to the technology right now

03:28.800 --> 03:44.160
yes I agree we should limit the use of technology in school like two hours per day maybe

03:44.480 --> 04:00.000
that could be interesting to to experiment that way of learning what do you think about a class of

04:00.000 --> 04:10.080
sensibilization we could make a place of sensibilization for parents and for students to show us

04:10.080 --> 04:23.920
the danger of the technology and maybe debate of the benefits and yes I totally agree with you

04:25.760 --> 04:38.560
I think it could be necessary to learn to parents and students the dangers of internet the

04:39.520 --> 04:50.480
extreme use of electronic devices on health for example on the ice and concentration etc

04:54.560 --> 05:03.920
and there is another thing we are not really agree for the technology using this school

05:04.560 --> 05:08.800
I hope the technology will not

05:13.280 --> 05:20.240
use for the homework because there is disparity social and I think that some students are not

05:20.240 --> 05:32.160
the capacity or the materials way to have a computer that they're on or so I think it's important

05:32.240 --> 05:44.400
to let the technology in into school yes or another solution is to ask parents if they have

05:44.400 --> 05:53.680
electronic devices at home and for the students who don't have electronic devices to do homework

05:54.240 --> 06:09.840
maybe school can provide us them a computer to to do their homeworks for example if they have to

06:09.840 --> 06:20.640
do expose that could be a solution for them to to work at home with technology okay

06:26.400 --> 06:26.880
time

06:27.200 --> 06:45.920
what time do you think we should impose to use technology at school

06:47.120 --> 06:55.520
you said two hours per day I am agree with that solution because I think two hours is not

06:56.320 --> 07:03.600
too much one hour is is not enough okay but two hours you have the time to make many things

07:05.600 --> 07:18.160
and I think it's enough okay and in what in what class do you think we should use it for

07:18.160 --> 07:29.280
example plastic art mathematics English okay I think we can use for mathematics French

07:29.280 --> 07:42.720
lesson just for grammar exercise one is about reduction I prefer paper of course but for just

07:42.800 --> 07:54.400
simple exercise computer technology is great way and mathematics of course physical one is

07:54.400 --> 08:05.680
possible SVT you can okay well you can use the technology for see video and it is more you know

08:06.000 --> 08:20.240
attractive for students okay I agree I think we should put in place two hours per day for

08:20.240 --> 08:21.520
these classes
