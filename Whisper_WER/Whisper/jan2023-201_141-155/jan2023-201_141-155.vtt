00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Okay. One for one will be one by five will be eight.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Okay. So this is about the article.

00:24.000 --> 00:38.000
I suggest to provide more about the animal testing and other progress.

00:38.000 --> 00:52.000
Yeah. I don't really, I don't think that we can write the article all about the progress

00:52.000 --> 01:04.000
about the animal testing because, like, they are not just progress about it.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah. Yeah. I understand what you said. I'm sure there was a lot of other things

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
we can talk about, but I think the main subject of the animal testing

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
is of the benefits we have thanks to. We can see of the medicine progress

01:26.000 --> 01:32.000
and of the new treatment medication.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
And I think there is a lot of things to say about it and it could be a good idea.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah. But the thing that you're talking about are not very relevant

01:44.000 --> 01:56.000
and not always relevant because we have seen a lot of progress in animal testing.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.000
Like, so, as during one, have you heard about this?

02:02.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh, yeah. Right. But it can be an example, but there is so much other medication

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
that the treatment worked. And they have been doing, okay, they tried animal testing

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
and it made it done work with this one and it was more relevant

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
with other things that, like, I don't know, computer needed.

02:25.000 --> 02:33.000
But this is, for the moment, the main, the most relevant practice

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
is my two progress in medicine study.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
I read some researchers that were saying that in fact,

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
a lot of animal testing experiences were not finished

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
and they need to know where, like, we don't have the results of them.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
A large number of animal testing experiences that have, you know,

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
benefits on our society or on medical research.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Yes. But as we can see, this is the one with the most.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
We don't really have a lot of, like, I don't think.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
We didn't work enough with other methods to be sure to take good one.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
And this one, I don't think it's my kind of idea,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.000
I think this one could be great for our article

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
and we maybe have much to say.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
To my mind, this is not quite a thing to do in our article

03:54.000 --> 04:02.000
because people are just there that I love this thing is good

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
and, like, the only thing, but it's not true at all.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
There are a lot of alternative methods.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
I know that sometimes alternative methods are not enough

04:15.000 --> 04:23.000
but in many cases there are enough and we don't use them enough.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Yes, it would be great to talk about it for sure.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
We need to give out the information to everybody and to give a better understanding of the today.

04:35.000 --> 04:44.000
But this is not the biggest argument, you know, what I mean.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
They need those information in the article

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
but to make today I keep my mind, it's that I'm noticing

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
and they put the argument about it.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
Because, yeah, we have a lot of other methods, they work,

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
but we also have the, you know, these three are...

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah, and I think it's a good argument to animal-dating

05:15.000 --> 05:26.000
because they change contents of the painful or the harmful they quote in faith to the animal

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
and they work with, but they still use the animal.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
I think so, it's maybe a good compromise between them.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah, these three are like a rule, but not everybody follows rules.

05:37.000 --> 05:50.000
And I think we have to think twice about the fact that we are doing like animals belong to us

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
but animals don't belong to us.

05:54.000 --> 06:06.000
They are just suffering in our laboratory and it's not like we are pretending

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
this is a right thing or we are not even thinking about it.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
It's not a subject that we talk about.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
We are pretending that it's okay, but I don't think so.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
This is maybe something we can add on the article

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
like you have you already and I have my interview

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
and we can work both together, but I think we need to clarify each point

06:32.000 --> 06:43.000
and it's a shade of grey and not everything is white or black.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, I can agree on something with you.

06:47.000 --> 06:57.000
But I think that for many years, your point of view has been showed

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
so I think it's a right thing to show my point of view.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah, but if we also try the two of them.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, yeah, I think they tell them.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
It's quite difficult.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
If we give only your point of view, everybody will be proud.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
We have to stop animal testing because this is the bad things.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
We just lost money.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
It's not relevant and we don't conclude anything

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
because we don't have good results or just any results.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
But that's not true because we have some results

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
and we chose an animal testing.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
It's for the moment the one who's working well

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
because we can still live like living cells.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And the interaction between them.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I can't say that in computer or anything.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
So I heard what you are saying.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
But I think so we can show your point of view.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
But we can also say that it's in many situations

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
we can do without animal testing.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
And if we need animal testing,

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
maybe we can think to hire less animal,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
less animals and in better conditions.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
And like in this motif, they are well-being.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
They are well-being because...

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
If we are doing less animal testing,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
we can do this in better conditions.

08:41.000 --> 08:51.000
I think this article can lead to a great information

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
and everybody can have their own opinion

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
with all the information.

08:59.000 --> 09:08.000
I think it's a good opportunity for the research service

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
because we will write a very interesting article

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
with our both point of view.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
And I'm glad that we are working together.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
And I think it's important.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Thank you very much.
