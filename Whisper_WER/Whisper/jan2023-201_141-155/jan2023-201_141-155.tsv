0	20000	Okay. One for one will be one by five will be eight.
20000	24000	Okay. So this is about the article.
24000	38000	I suggest to provide more about the animal testing and other progress.
38000	52000	Yeah. I don't really, I don't think that we can write the article all about the progress
52000	64000	about the animal testing because, like, they are not just progress about it.
64000	71000	Yeah. Yeah. I understand what you said. I'm sure there was a lot of other things
71000	78000	we can talk about, but I think the main subject of the animal testing
78000	86000	is of the benefits we have thanks to. We can see of the medicine progress
86000	92000	and of the new treatment medication.
92000	98000	And I think there is a lot of things to say about it and it could be a good idea.
98000	104000	Yeah. But the thing that you're talking about are not very relevant
104000	116000	and not always relevant because we have seen a lot of progress in animal testing.
116000	122000	Like, so, as during one, have you heard about this?
122000	130000	Oh, yeah. Right. But it can be an example, but there is so much other medication
130000	136000	that the treatment worked. And they have been doing, okay, they tried animal testing
136000	141000	and it made it done work with this one and it was more relevant
141000	145000	with other things that, like, I don't know, computer needed.
145000	153000	But this is, for the moment, the main, the most relevant practice
153000	159000	is my two progress in medicine study.
159000	165000	I read some researchers that were saying that in fact,
165000	173000	a lot of animal testing experiences were not finished
173000	180000	and they need to know where, like, we don't have the results of them.
180000	186000	A large number of animal testing experiences that have, you know,
186000	193000	benefits on our society or on medical research.
193000	199000	Yes. But as we can see, this is the one with the most.
199000	206000	We don't really have a lot of, like, I don't think.
206000	213000	We didn't work enough with other methods to be sure to take good one.
213000	218000	And this one, I don't think it's my kind of idea,
218000	222000	I think this one could be great for our article
222000	228000	and we maybe have much to say.
228000	234000	To my mind, this is not quite a thing to do in our article
234000	242000	because people are just there that I love this thing is good
242000	246000	and, like, the only thing, but it's not true at all.
246000	249000	There are a lot of alternative methods.
249000	255000	I know that sometimes alternative methods are not enough
255000	263000	but in many cases there are enough and we don't use them enough.
263000	267000	Yes, it would be great to talk about it for sure.
267000	275000	We need to give out the information to everybody and to give a better understanding of the today.
275000	284000	But this is not the biggest argument, you know, what I mean.
284000	290000	They need those information in the article
290000	296000	but to make today I keep my mind, it's that I'm noticing
296000	299000	and they put the argument about it.
299000	305000	Because, yeah, we have a lot of other methods, they work,
305000	310000	but we also have the, you know, these three are...
310000	315000	Yeah, and I think it's a good argument to animal-dating
315000	326000	because they change contents of the painful or the harmful they quote in faith to the animal
326000	329000	and they work with, but they still use the animal.
329000	332000	I think so, it's maybe a good compromise between them.
332000	337000	Yeah, these three are like a rule, but not everybody follows rules.
337000	350000	And I think we have to think twice about the fact that we are doing like animals belong to us
350000	354000	but animals don't belong to us.
354000	366000	They are just suffering in our laboratory and it's not like we are pretending
366000	371000	this is a right thing or we are not even thinking about it.
371000	374000	It's not a subject that we talk about.
374000	378000	We are pretending that it's okay, but I don't think so.
378000	382000	This is maybe something we can add on the article
382000	385000	like you have you already and I have my interview
385000	392000	and we can work both together, but I think we need to clarify each point
392000	403000	and it's a shade of grey and not everything is white or black.
403000	407000	Yeah, I can agree on something with you.
407000	417000	But I think that for many years, your point of view has been showed
417000	422000	so I think it's a right thing to show my point of view.
422000	426000	Yeah, but if we also try the two of them.
426000	428000	Yeah, yeah, I think they tell them.
428000	429000	It's quite difficult.
429000	434000	If we give only your point of view, everybody will be proud.
434000	438000	We have to stop animal testing because this is the bad things.
438000	440000	We just lost money.
440000	443000	It's not relevant and we don't conclude anything
443000	448000	because we don't have good results or just any results.
448000	452000	But that's not true because we have some results
452000	456000	and we chose an animal testing.
456000	462000	It's for the moment the one who's working well
462000	469000	because we can still live like living cells.
470000	473000	And the interaction between them.
473000	476000	I can't say that in computer or anything.
476000	479000	So I heard what you are saying.
479000	483000	But I think so we can show your point of view.
483000	490000	But we can also say that it's in many situations
490000	493000	we can do without animal testing.
493000	496000	And if we need animal testing,
496000	501000	maybe we can think to hire less animal,
501000	504000	less animals and in better conditions.
504000	509000	And like in this motif, they are well-being.
509000	512000	They are well-being because...
512000	517000	If we are doing less animal testing,
517000	520000	we can do this in better conditions.
521000	531000	I think this article can lead to a great information
531000	535000	and everybody can have their own opinion
535000	539000	with all the information.
539000	548000	I think it's a good opportunity for the research service
548000	554000	because we will write a very interesting article
554000	557000	with our both point of view.
557000	560000	And I'm glad that we are working together.
560000	562000	And I think it's important.
562000	565000	Thank you very much.
