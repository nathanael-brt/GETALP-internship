0	8000	0.41 and roll A. 0.27, roll B.
8000	18000	So in my opinion, it's necessary to develop the technology in high school and in every
18000	29000	high school because is that allowed to improve the knowledge of the students and it's
29000	43000	a good point for their future job and in studies in a university or something like that.
43000	52000	OK, but I understand what you say, but I think that it's not possible in all schools because
52000	69000	there are some schools who don't have the money to add new technologies in their schools.
69000	79000	Yeah, but I think it's important to to block this gap between the different high school because
79000	93000	I'm agree with you. Everybody can have access to the technology student from poor high school or very good
93000	100000	high school. There is no difference for me. Everybody has the right to access all the technology
100000	104000	and it's necessary for me.
104000	114000	It can be necessary, but if students didn't have a computer, their own computer,
114000	119000	how can they do their homework, for example?
119000	138000	Yes, but for that, I think the state can make a decision to put the budget and allowed
138000	152000	the high school to have good technologies like computer, good system, informatics system, etc.
152000	164000	OK, it's a good idea, but this is not the only problem. There is also about teachers
164000	173000	because some of them are not able to use new technologies.
173000	182000	Maybe they are old or they didn't understand very well.
182000	199000	Maybe we can help this whole teacher with give them information and some teachers specialized
199000	209000	in informatics and new technology can help them to be formed from that new form of scholarship.
209000	219000	Yes, but new technology is not easy and they need really a lot of time to really understand
219000	229000	how it works and it's not really, we don't have a lot of time to teach them how to use it.
229000	237000	Yes, maybe it's difficult to spend a lot of time to be formed with new technology,
237000	245000	but it's dramatically dramatic because I think it's good for students
245000	253000	because they can help them to develop their abilities to resolve problems
253000	267000	and to improve their knowledge about this type of technology.
268000	282000	Yes, but studies shows too that students who use new technology in school develop anxiety.
282000	285000	So it's not a...
285000	291000	It's need to be framed maybe because there is good points and by points.
291000	302000	So we can not just drop this form of new system.
302000	314000	Just like that, we need to improve to inform everybody, students, teachers, everybody.
314000	325000	To my opinion, we need to reduce the time the students spend on computers, television,
325000	337000	just to reduce this time because they spend too much time on this at home
337000	348000	and if they are on computer at school too, there will be too much time for them.
348000	359000	I think it's a problem. They need to return at paper and pen to write to read too.
360000	368000	For the development of this new system, we can begin with one, for example, one hour per day
368000	378000	with computers and new technology, but keep going with the old method with paper and pen
378000	396000	because technology also has a limit because in my opinion, it's more easy to learn a lesson with paper or without a screen.
397000	409000	I think we can close the deal just to add a little of new technology on class,
409000	423000	maybe one or two hour per day, but we can keep also traditional way to teach.
423000	426000	Yeah, I'm gonna read.
