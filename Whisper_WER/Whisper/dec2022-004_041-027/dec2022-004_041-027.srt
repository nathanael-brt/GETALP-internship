1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
0.41 and roll A. 0.27, roll B.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So in my opinion, it's necessary to develop the technology in high school and in every

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,000
high school because is that allowed to improve the knowledge of the students and it's

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:43,000
a good point for their future job and in studies in a university or something like that.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
OK, but I understand what you say, but I think that it's not possible in all schools because

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:09,000
there are some schools who don't have the money to add new technologies in their schools.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, but I think it's important to to block this gap between the different high school because

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm agree with you. Everybody can have access to the technology student from poor high school or very good

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
high school. There is no difference for me. Everybody has the right to access all the technology

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and it's necessary for me.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It can be necessary, but if students didn't have a computer, their own computer,

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
how can they do their homework, for example?

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes, but for that, I think the state can make a decision to put the budget and allowed

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the high school to have good technologies like computer, good system, informatics system, etc.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:44,000
OK, it's a good idea, but this is not the only problem. There is also about teachers

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,000
because some of them are not able to use new technologies.

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Maybe they are old or they didn't understand very well.

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Maybe we can help this whole teacher with give them information and some teachers specialized

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
in informatics and new technology can help them to be formed from that new form of scholarship.

20
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes, but new technology is not easy and they need really a lot of time to really understand

21
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
how it works and it's not really, we don't have a lot of time to teach them how to use it.

22
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes, maybe it's difficult to spend a lot of time to be formed with new technology,

23
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but it's dramatically dramatic because I think it's good for students

24
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
because they can help them to develop their abilities to resolve problems

25
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and to improve their knowledge about this type of technology.

26
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes, but studies shows too that students who use new technology in school develop anxiety.

27
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So it's not a...

28
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's need to be framed maybe because there is good points and by points.

29
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So we can not just drop this form of new system.

30
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Just like that, we need to improve to inform everybody, students, teachers, everybody.

31
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:25,000
To my opinion, we need to reduce the time the students spend on computers, television,

32
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:37,000
just to reduce this time because they spend too much time on this at home

33
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and if they are on computer at school too, there will be too much time for them.

34
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I think it's a problem. They need to return at paper and pen to write to read too.

35
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
For the development of this new system, we can begin with one, for example, one hour per day

36
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:18,000
with computers and new technology, but keep going with the old method with paper and pen

37
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:36,000
because technology also has a limit because in my opinion, it's more easy to learn a lesson with paper or without a screen.

38
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think we can close the deal just to add a little of new technology on class,

39
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:03,000
maybe one or two hour per day, but we can keep also traditional way to teach.

40
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, I'm gonna read.
