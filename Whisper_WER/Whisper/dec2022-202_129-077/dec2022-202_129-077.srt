00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Number 129, roll A. Number 767, roll B. So hello, today we are going to discuss about

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the issues we are going to suggest to our supervisor if we have to put technologies on

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:35,000
the classroom if we don't have to implement this in the classroom. So first, I think that

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
this is a good thing to implement this type of technology like computers in the classroom

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
in the course and the school in general because I think the first students like it and there

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
is already studies that have showed that there is a higher level of engagement. For example,

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
for students who don't like to talk because they are a little scared.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello, I share your view. But for me, I think that new technologies have problems.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:36,000
These technologies can distract the students when they are in class. For example, if a student

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
can play on this computer, those other students next to him can be distracted by them.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I get short point here, but I think that even if there is no computer on the classroom,

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
there is already a possible student who can play on the phone or something else.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And that already can distract the other students behind them, but I get short point here and I agree with you.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, it's true, but another problem of new technology is the cost of this technology.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's very expensive to buy a computer and at risk a student can't buy a computer expensive

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and they can have problems to access to network connection when they are at home.

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And it can create a...

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It creates a disadvantage for these students.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, I understand, but I think that this is not the athletes' student who buy this computer.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I think that school where they are in must buy this computer for them.

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Like this is already happening in some area where the state gives free computers to students and students don't have to pay them.

22
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's a good idea, but for me, moreover, a buy of a computer for at risk a student,

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:59,000
the teacher needs to have a formation to know how to integrate this technology in class without a student.

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Maybe you want to say that this is a little lost of time and I think that this is a lost of time in the present.

25
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But after, I think that thanks to these technology and computers, students will learn lessons and skills more fast, faster.

26
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So I think that the time will be gained after.

27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, I got on with you there, but for me it's a good thing because a student can learn faster.

28
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But the major problem is that the students have a sixth or eighth screen by day.

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But if they use the screen at school, it can increase this time spend on the looking screen.

30
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And it can provide anxiety for the students.

31
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay, I go along with you.

32
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think that all students and people today are a bit addicted to this type of technology like computers or fun.

33
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But I think that this is the students or the people at home who have to reduce the time they are using this technology because it is very useful in the school I think.

34
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, it's true.

35
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And for me, we need to integrate this technology at school, but we need to limit the time spent on this screen.

36
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It can be a tool to integrate at a traditional method to learn.

37
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's in addition to this traditional method.

38
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, okay. Yes, I think that we have to just not use them, use the computers and this technology every day at school.

39
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But I think this is a good idea to add computers in classroom and more.

40
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It can help for future jobs because now all jobs will be like engineers for artificial intelligence.

41
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And so we have to have a student who learn this type of skills to have a good jobs in the future.

42
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Firstly, it's a good thing for a job in the future that if we want to use this technology at school, we need to regulate them and begin to use this technology.

43
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But before a certain age, like six years or ten years?

44
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes, I agree.

45
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We don't have to put children at like five or four years old, directly in this type of technology.

46
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We have to before know the life.

47
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But yes, we have to regulate them like maybe twice a week or maybe just a few class or a course.

48
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, twice a week is a good idea because it keeps the advantage of this technology too long faster and it reduces the anxiety of the screen.

49
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay, so I think that we are finished and I agree with you with the twice a week and I think this is a good idea.
