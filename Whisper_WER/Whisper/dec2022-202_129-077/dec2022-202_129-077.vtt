Number 129, roll A. Number 767, roll B. So hello, today we are going to discuss about

00:14.000 --> 00:23.000
the issues we are going to suggest to our supervisor if we have to put technologies on

00:23.000 --> 00:35.000
the classroom if we don't have to implement this in the classroom. So first, I think that

00:35.000 --> 00:43.000
this is a good thing to implement this type of technology like computers in the classroom

00:43.000 --> 00:52.000
in the course and the school in general because I think the first students like it and there

00:52.000 --> 01:02.000
is already studies that have showed that there is a higher level of engagement. For example,

01:02.000 --> 01:11.000
for students who don't like to talk because they are a little scared.

01:12.000 --> 01:22.000
Hello, I share your view. But for me, I think that new technologies have problems.

01:22.000 --> 01:36.000
These technologies can distract the students when they are in class. For example, if a student

01:36.000 --> 01:45.000
can play on this computer, those other students next to him can be distracted by them.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.000
I get short point here, but I think that even if there is no computer on the classroom,

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
there is already a possible student who can play on the phone or something else.

02:03.000 --> 02:14.000
And that already can distract the other students behind them, but I get short point here and I agree with you.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah, it's true, but another problem of new technology is the cost of this technology.

02:24.000 --> 02:37.000
It's very expensive to buy a computer and at risk a student can't buy a computer expensive

02:37.000 --> 02:47.000
and they can have problems to access to network connection when they are at home.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
And it can create a...

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
It creates a disadvantage for these students.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
Okay, I understand, but I think that this is not the athletes' student who buy this computer.

03:06.000 --> 03:15.000
I think that school where they are in must buy this computer for them.

03:15.000 --> 03:28.000
Like this is already happening in some area where the state gives free computers to students and students don't have to pay them.

03:28.000 --> 03:41.000
It's a good idea, but for me, moreover, a buy of a computer for at risk a student,

03:41.000 --> 03:59.000
the teacher needs to have a formation to know how to integrate this technology in class without a student.

04:00.000 --> 04:12.000
Maybe you want to say that this is a little lost of time and I think that this is a lost of time in the present.

04:12.000 --> 04:24.000
But after, I think that thanks to these technology and computers, students will learn lessons and skills more fast, faster.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
So I think that the time will be gained after.

04:30.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah, I got on with you there, but for me it's a good thing because a student can learn faster.

04:41.000 --> 04:54.000
But the major problem is that the students have a sixth or eighth screen by day.

04:54.000 --> 05:05.000
But if they use the screen at school, it can increase this time spend on the looking screen.

05:05.000 --> 05:17.000
And it can provide anxiety for the students.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Okay, I go along with you.

05:20.000 --> 05:33.000
I think that all students and people today are a bit addicted to this type of technology like computers or fun.

05:33.000 --> 05:50.000
But I think that this is the students or the people at home who have to reduce the time they are using this technology because it is very useful in the school I think.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Yeah, it's true.

05:52.000 --> 06:05.000
And for me, we need to integrate this technology at school, but we need to limit the time spent on this screen.

06:05.000 --> 06:15.000
It can be a tool to integrate at a traditional method to learn.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
It's in addition to this traditional method.

06:20.000 --> 06:31.000
Okay, okay. Yes, I think that we have to just not use them, use the computers and this technology every day at school.

06:31.000 --> 06:39.000
But I think this is a good idea to add computers in classroom and more.

06:39.000 --> 06:52.000
It can help for future jobs because now all jobs will be like engineers for artificial intelligence.

06:52.000 --> 07:02.000
And so we have to have a student who learn this type of skills to have a good jobs in the future.

07:02.000 --> 07:28.000
Firstly, it's a good thing for a job in the future that if we want to use this technology at school, we need to regulate them and begin to use this technology.

07:28.000 --> 07:36.000
But before a certain age, like six years or ten years?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
Yes, I agree.

07:39.000 --> 07:52.000
We don't have to put children at like five or four years old, directly in this type of technology.

07:52.000 --> 07:59.000
We have to before know the life.

07:59.000 --> 08:13.000
But yes, we have to regulate them like maybe twice a week or maybe just a few class or a course.

08:13.000 --> 08:31.000
Yes, twice a week is a good idea because it keeps the advantage of this technology too long faster and it reduces the anxiety of the screen.

08:31.000 --> 08:43.000
Okay, so I think that we are finished and I agree with you with the twice a week and I think this is a good idea.
