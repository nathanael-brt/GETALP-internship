00:00.000 --> 00:28.640
So I think for the news, for the article, we have to show that it's important to keep

00:28.640 --> 00:38.800
the animal testing because we don't have choice to do some tests in medicines in another way.

00:40.000 --> 00:54.720
I agree with you on the fact that we have no other solution to stop animal testing,

00:54.720 --> 01:08.560
but I don't think it's a good idea to speak for animal testing, but most against animal testing,

01:08.560 --> 01:26.160
because if people with our article, I think it's important to show that this technique

01:26.160 --> 01:31.840
hurts animals and can kill them.

01:31.840 --> 01:43.840
So you want to speak in an objective way, or you want to give some arguments in the favour of animal testing?

01:43.840 --> 01:55.120
I think it's not possible to speak about the favour of animal testing.

01:55.120 --> 02:06.800
I think I miss and understand myself, because I think we don't have the choice to have to keep the animal testing.

02:06.800 --> 02:15.360
We don't have the other way, but you think we have to do not do this practice. Why?

02:15.520 --> 02:28.960
Because animals are also conscientious, like you and me, and in reality, I think you don't want to test some drugs,

02:28.960 --> 02:37.520
some things which cause the earth to you and kill you.

02:37.600 --> 02:49.760
Yes, but I think human life is better and more important than an animal life, and that's why we don't

02:49.760 --> 02:58.080
test on a child or on a person who has a life where we're conscientious. Animals don't have

02:58.720 --> 03:06.160
a conscience. They'll feel pain, yes, but they don't have a mind and a conscience and a

03:06.160 --> 03:14.160
sophisticated mind, so we don't have the choice. We have to test the medicine in a tissue and

03:14.160 --> 03:27.200
biological tissue on animals. Yes, but okay, if you want, animals are not conscientious, but it's

03:27.200 --> 03:35.920
a part of our world, of our biodiversity, of our environment, and it's very important to keep

03:35.920 --> 03:55.920
their biodiversity in good way. So I think there are other solutions to test medical tests,

03:55.920 --> 04:10.560
so it's not only the solution. You think about what the other way of testing, like new technologies

04:10.560 --> 04:17.280
or just in other way of testing? New technology and other way, but new technology, we are in the

04:17.280 --> 04:32.080
Soviet society, which are in increase and in developing, and all day we are new technology

04:32.080 --> 04:41.360
and new things to increase the world, so we can find a solution to stop animal testing.

04:41.360 --> 04:54.400
Yes, but today at the moment, when we talk, a many of work show that other way of testing are

04:54.400 --> 05:04.400
not benefits and not very scientist. We have just a normal way of testing is animal, maybe in the

05:04.400 --> 05:14.800
future, if we have the money, if we have the knowledge, we can't create just things of simulation

05:14.800 --> 05:24.880
of the human body, but today it's so complicated, I don't know how to create a machine like that,

05:25.600 --> 05:34.000
so I don't have the solution and so for me we have to keep the animal testing because I don't

05:34.000 --> 05:41.760
know the way of construction, we have to build this kind of technology.

05:44.800 --> 05:54.960
I'm a higher boy because the technology is not with the technology is not possible

05:55.040 --> 06:04.960
today to stop animal testing, but in our article, I think it's important to say that

06:06.960 --> 06:16.000
we have, they have a lot of research on technology to stop animal testing and we don't agree,

06:16.960 --> 06:29.840
we disagree, we disagree with the fact of animal testing, but today we don't do with another solution.

06:30.720 --> 06:39.680
And so do you think that we can replace entirely animals because for me,

06:40.560 --> 06:50.240
we are, even if we have some technologies like simulation, like computer, in the future,

06:50.240 --> 06:59.120
we have to keep animals because it's the most, the most closer of human if we don't want to test on

06:59.120 --> 07:09.120
human. Maybe you can reduce this number of animals, but not completely stop this kind of project.

07:09.760 --> 07:23.520
In my mind, in the future, with the evolution of technology, it will completely

07:23.520 --> 07:34.320
be possible, it will be completely possible to stop animal testing, not just reduce, but stop.

07:34.320 --> 07:45.760
Because we have, today we invent a lot of things and I think if we take a little of a whole time

07:45.760 --> 07:56.800
to think about this problem, I think we can find a solution for stop radically animal testing.

07:58.560 --> 08:07.360
Yes, but I disagree with that because that's supposed the fact that we have to create some biological

08:07.360 --> 08:14.720
tissues like human tissue and that's supposed the fact we have to create new humans with

08:15.360 --> 08:23.680
machines like Archifersially. So I think it's unichicol. For me, we have to keep

08:23.680 --> 08:30.480
animal testing because yes, it's not it's unichicol, but the other way is also unichicol. So

08:31.440 --> 08:41.920
it's just we have to reduce at the maximum the risk of suffering that it's very complicated situation.

08:43.280 --> 08:58.880
Okay, so for this article, I think with all of we say that this article should be objective,

08:59.040 --> 09:10.480
talk about animal testing, the argument in favor of animal testing and against animal testing,

09:10.480 --> 09:20.000
I think it's a good way and I think it's very important to talk about the new technology,

09:20.000 --> 09:28.640
the new method to stop animal testing. Yeah, I think we have to, I agree with you for the start,

09:28.640 --> 09:36.640
I think we have to to show the two ways of thinking and make some tailoring for the future.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.840
So thank you.
