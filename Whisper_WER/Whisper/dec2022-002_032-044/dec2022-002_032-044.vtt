00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Number 32, I have the roll-up.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Number 44, roll-up.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
You want to start?

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Maybe, why not?

00:16.000 --> 00:25.000
Yes, so our foundation wants to invest in technology for classroom.

00:25.000 --> 00:32.000
I think it's an idea because we are in the 21st century.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
But we have some problems with that.

00:36.000 --> 00:47.000
And I want to show you why I'm maybe to model a writer's technology using

00:47.000 --> 00:58.000
because I think, firstly, it's a potential problem with connection.

00:58.000 --> 01:08.000
And with this problem, we can have some losing time for teachers.

01:08.000 --> 01:17.000
And I'm afraid that I could not have the best solution for the student.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Okay, I understand your point of view.

01:20.000 --> 01:31.000
I think the problems can be solved with the experts that we can hide

01:31.000 --> 01:41.000
to come help the teachers in class to avoid time loss.

01:41.000 --> 01:52.000
And we have to make formations for teachers to avoid the time loss with technical problems.

01:52.000 --> 02:05.000
And I think we must do all of that because we have to use technology in operation

02:05.000 --> 02:17.000
because it can reduce inequalities between the students that are more affluent

02:17.000 --> 02:26.000
and the ones who live in less affluent situations.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
So we have to do all that.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Yes, but I see two major problems.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
But I understand that I think we will have a problem of cost because it's very expensive

02:43.000 --> 02:55.000
to have people to hire, to be here for this information problem.

02:55.000 --> 03:09.000
And you say you want to learn to teacher maybe to solve this problem themselves

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
but it's also very expensive to learn to them.

03:16.000 --> 03:33.000
And I think you spoke about inequality but some low incomes students will have technology in classroom.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
It's a good idea.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.000
I have no problem but you don't think that when they come back home,

03:44.000 --> 03:57.000
if they don't have a connection or good technology, maybe they will be in a situation of inequality because of that.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
It's a question.

04:00.000 --> 04:10.000
Or we can invest for EBSM, for JAK or other way, I don't know.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
But it's very expensive.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
And this is a problem of money.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
Yes, indeed, the problem of money is a very big problem.

04:25.000 --> 04:38.000
To counter that, we have to make plans to replace the material and also make updates.

04:38.000 --> 04:49.000
That can be considered in the budget of the foundation.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
So I think that's a problem but we can do with that.

04:57.000 --> 05:18.000
Also, yes, you said that the students that have less money can have internet at home and that can be a issue with their own blocks.

05:18.000 --> 05:27.000
And yes, as you said, we can provide them computers or 4G keys.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Because that's very important.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
You talked about 20th century skills that are leaning before.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
That's important that all the students can have those 20th century skills.

05:45.000 --> 05:58.000
And that's important that all of the students can have access to computers and internet.

05:58.000 --> 06:16.000
Okay, so if you think to program and invest on the long time and we can maybe reduce the cost like that, I'm totally agree with this project.

06:16.000 --> 06:29.000
But I have also another issue that I think is in the equation of this system for different points.

06:29.000 --> 06:58.000
I think to the example for university and others that are writing test and maybe as a student who are dyslexic, maybe it could be more difficult for them with technology that are writing.

06:58.000 --> 07:20.000
So I suggest you to moderate and keep paper and pen and paper, methodology, even we can introduce technology and it's not a problem.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
Just keep a part of old school.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
Yes, you're totally right.

07:30.000 --> 07:48.000
For this problem, yes, as you said, we have to keep the pencil and paper based learning because as you said, state programs are traditional.

07:48.000 --> 07:56.000
And the tests must be with pencil and paper.

07:56.000 --> 08:10.000
So a plus we have to keep this way or leaning because the time that spend young people on screens are already high.

08:10.000 --> 08:28.000
So it must be not too high because it can cause anxiety and the social skills can be compromised.

08:28.000 --> 08:37.000
So yes, we have indeed the world to limit this time on the screen.

08:37.000 --> 08:52.000
I agree with you, but I think we can use technology called learning.

08:52.000 --> 09:07.000
So I think we can go to this big investment for school, but it's clear for you and me and I very happy for that.

09:07.000 --> 09:15.000
It's that we have to be careful to maintain old school methodology, but it's very important.

09:15.000 --> 09:26.000
I agree to continue to invest further for our century and for the disease students.

09:26.000 --> 09:36.000
Okay, so I'm glad that our students can provide the technological learning in the future.
