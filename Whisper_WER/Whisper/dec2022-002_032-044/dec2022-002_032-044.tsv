0	4000	Number 32, I have the roll-up.
4000	7000	Number 44, roll-up.
10000	13000	You want to start?
13000	16000	Maybe, why not?
16000	25000	Yes, so our foundation wants to invest in technology for classroom.
25000	32000	I think it's an idea because we are in the 21st century.
32000	36000	But we have some problems with that.
36000	47000	And I want to show you why I'm maybe to model a writer's technology using
47000	58000	because I think, firstly, it's a potential problem with connection.
58000	68000	And with this problem, we can have some losing time for teachers.
68000	77000	And I'm afraid that I could not have the best solution for the student.
77000	80000	Okay, I understand your point of view.
80000	91000	I think the problems can be solved with the experts that we can hide
91000	101000	to come help the teachers in class to avoid time loss.
101000	112000	And we have to make formations for teachers to avoid the time loss with technical problems.
112000	125000	And I think we must do all of that because we have to use technology in operation
125000	137000	because it can reduce inequalities between the students that are more affluent
137000	146000	and the ones who live in less affluent situations.
146000	149000	So we have to do all that.
149000	155000	Yes, but I see two major problems.
155000	163000	But I understand that I think we will have a problem of cost because it's very expensive
163000	175000	to have people to hire, to be here for this information problem.
175000	189000	And you say you want to learn to teacher maybe to solve this problem themselves
189000	196000	but it's also very expensive to learn to them.
196000	213000	And I think you spoke about inequality but some low incomes students will have technology in classroom.
213000	216000	It's a good idea.
216000	224000	I have no problem but you don't think that when they come back home,
224000	237000	if they don't have a connection or good technology, maybe they will be in a situation of inequality because of that.
237000	240000	It's a question.
240000	250000	Or we can invest for EBSM, for JAK or other way, I don't know.
250000	254000	But it's very expensive.
254000	259000	And this is a problem of money.
259000	265000	Yes, indeed, the problem of money is a very big problem.
265000	278000	To counter that, we have to make plans to replace the material and also make updates.
278000	289000	That can be considered in the budget of the foundation.
289000	297000	So I think that's a problem but we can do with that.
297000	318000	Also, yes, you said that the students that have less money can have internet at home and that can be a issue with their own blocks.
318000	327000	And yes, as you said, we can provide them computers or 4G keys.
327000	331000	Because that's very important.
331000	337000	You talked about 20th century skills that are leaning before.
337000	345000	That's important that all the students can have those 20th century skills.
345000	358000	And that's important that all of the students can have access to computers and internet.
358000	376000	Okay, so if you think to program and invest on the long time and we can maybe reduce the cost like that, I'm totally agree with this project.
376000	389000	But I have also another issue that I think is in the equation of this system for different points.
389000	418000	I think to the example for university and others that are writing test and maybe as a student who are dyslexic, maybe it could be more difficult for them with technology that are writing.
418000	440000	So I suggest you to moderate and keep paper and pen and paper, methodology, even we can introduce technology and it's not a problem.
440000	445000	Just keep a part of old school.
445000	450000	Yes, you're totally right.
450000	468000	For this problem, yes, as you said, we have to keep the pencil and paper based learning because as you said, state programs are traditional.
468000	476000	And the tests must be with pencil and paper.
476000	490000	So a plus we have to keep this way or leaning because the time that spend young people on screens are already high.
490000	508000	So it must be not too high because it can cause anxiety and the social skills can be compromised.
508000	517000	So yes, we have indeed the world to limit this time on the screen.
517000	532000	I agree with you, but I think we can use technology called learning.
532000	547000	So I think we can go to this big investment for school, but it's clear for you and me and I very happy for that.
547000	555000	It's that we have to be careful to maintain old school methodology, but it's very important.
555000	566000	I agree to continue to invest further for our century and for the disease students.
566000	576000	Okay, so I'm glad that our students can provide the technological learning in the future.
