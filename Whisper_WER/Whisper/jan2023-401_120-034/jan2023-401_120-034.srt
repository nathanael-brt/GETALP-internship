1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,720
When you're ready, okay, so we should write some article about animal testing.

2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,720
Yes.

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,560
What do you think about it?

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:35,560
I think I have a clear, clear, clear, clear pause issue about animal testing.

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:44,520
I just think this is an archaic method, completely outdated, and we have to just think about

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:53,800
how we can do this experience without animal testing.

7
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Because that's just wasting money for nothing, because any solution could replace this animal

8
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
testing experience.

9
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,320
Okay, so we have a problem because I disagree.

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:22,720
I think we should write this article in favor of animal testing, because this method

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:32,720
allows breakthrough in science and research for scientific and to understanding the human

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,480
body and human disease and everything.

13
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:48,520
So for me, animal testing is the right method to allow the humanity to have a better life

14
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,720
with understanding this function.

15
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
Okay.

16
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,120
Okay, I correct you just in one point.

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,640
Maybe in the past, it was a very great solution.

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:11,160
It was completely great to understand, as you say, the functioning of our belief, understand

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:31,160
our physical constructions, but today, we have to think ethically and we humanize our science.

20
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:39,160
But we can do that, we humanize our science, and you think animals like in a better way

21
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
than before.

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
It's great to me.

23
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:52,480
But before we don't want to be anything to kill any day, for example, we can use animals

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:01,480
and testing animals for some subject, but not for other, like, for example, cosmetic testing

25
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
animals.

26
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
It's a shame.

27
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Okay.

28
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
An nonsense.

29
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Okay.

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:17,480
No, because we have alternatives, but like, for example, human disease, sometimes we

31
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,480
don't have the correct alternative, like, for example.

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
It's false.

33
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
It's the same virus.

34
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:31,780
No, as I'm saying, in the case of Alzheimer's, in the mask, we have, we can cure mice who

35
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:41,040
have Alzheimer's, but we cannot translate it for now, at the human, because we didn't understand

36
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:50,400
the molecular basis, but to take an alternative, we can use, for example, a computer alternative.

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Yes.

38
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,080
But to use it, we have to understand the molecular basis.

39
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,800
So if we don't have the molecular analysis, we cannot use alternative, before you have

40
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:06,320
to find the alternative by animal testing, what do you think?

41
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:15,160
What do you think about to create a process of experimentation in vitro, by example,

42
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:26,200
for, in the same time, in the second time, we can effectively create a program in computer

43
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:34,440
modellization, which are very, very, very performance, more, maybe, more, in the, in the

44
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:46,560
other, lot of time, maybe, more performance, that's animal testing, where, computer modellization

45
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,800
are more efficient in a lot of time, but it's not a question, so, we could, we could

46
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:01,520
say that, okay, it was the past, we did animal testing, and we know the functioning of

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:10,080
our body, and the body, and the cellular, that, that create disease, et cetera, okay.

48
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:21,920
But now, it's time to, transit to a way of science, which are more human, and when, we

49
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,120
didn't talk about money, what money?

50
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,680
We are the subventions, because we are, legally, we have, legally, the obligation to do animal

51
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,160
testing, it's right in a lot of creative ways. Yes, but a lot of, there, there is more

52
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:51,360
suppression, as you say, to have, when we are, when we are in the program, in the RS program,

53
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,960
in the RS program, or RS program, you know, or with the, we are just seeing the trigger. So,

54
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:09,440
if we are, coming in, or RS program, trigger, we have more subventions, and that could be

55
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:19,360
transition step, between, between the, the experience with animals, and without animals. But,

56
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:30,880
I just want to, to say, one, one, one, one thing, one fact, 26 billions of dollars, that have been

57
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:44,640
invests in, experience animal testing, and just 95 persons did not succeed, we didn't translate

58
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:53,280
the medicant for human, that we test on animals. Yes, it's really good. We could put all this money

59
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:02,000
on computing, computer modelization, which, increase, which will be, which will increase more and

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,920
more, the performance of, computing, computer modelization. Yes, but like I said, it's not about

61
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:21,360
efficient, and increase the development, it's about reality, and reality, and point of the world.

62
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,680
It's like, if you don't understand the buzzes, yes, you can, we know the buzzes. No, we don't know

63
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,080
the buzzes, we know the buzzes. So, how, what is the basis of other animals?

64
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:40,880
Oh, sorry, I'm not in scientific lessons, or grades, or so we don't have the buzzes. So, we have

65
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,760
to find it, maybe, maybe you're right, and maybe we can take the point of view of the

66
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,280
middle, like the triage. I'm okay with the triage, but with the triage, maybe, maybe, maybe

67
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,560
acceleration, acceleration of the triage. We cannot accelerate it. When the triage has been

68
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:12,240
created, 15th, in the 15th. Yes, but it's a plan of long time. Are you okay to say that it's

69
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:22,720
outdated? We have to create a new model with acceleration, but we can't skip the animal testing,

70
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,000
in the future, in the future. No, in the future, we can't, but no, we can't. How many years?

71
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:36,720
25 years? 25 years? No, we have to create the acceleration of triage, that could be

72
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:48,400
the speed triage. Okay, so, alternative. We write our article about the triage, and you do your

73
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:55,360
research about the speed triage after the article. No, didn't? No, we could just complete,

74
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,320
create a compromise with your review. I have to get a compromise, your review. No, no, no, no,

75
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,400
you want to skip the animal testing in the 25 years. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I want to write

76
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:17,920
our article. Our article. Our article. Create a barrier between us, you man, that we are just

77
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:28,400
exploiting the rest of nature. It's just outdated. It was in the 19th, in the 20th century. Okay,

78
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:36,080
it was great, and we understand the function of genesis, etc. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We have

79
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,000
to write an article and choose an article. Okay, so, so, you can write, it's outdated.

80
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,080
I can write. No, no, no, listen to me. You write, it's outdated. I write, we still do it,

81
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:58,240
and we write the triage metals. Yes, we've read it. Okay, could we just

82
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,360
notify that we could accelerate the triage metals at the conclusion, at the conclusion,

83
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,040
at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the

84
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:13,200
last, the last song of the fence. Oh, you, you are, you are, you are, you are, but we are okay to say

85
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,640
that 25 years to skip the animal testing is two. Three ago. Okay.
