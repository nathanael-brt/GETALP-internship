okay i understand you point of view but for me i think that it can it could improve their capacities but it also could distract them when they are in class and they just look at the screen and i for me and for therapists also students and young people are already too much in front of a screen we can heard before that they are six or eight hours per day in front of screen and if new technologies are allowed in school we couldnt reduce this screen time
