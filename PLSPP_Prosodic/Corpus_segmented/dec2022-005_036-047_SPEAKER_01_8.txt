yes but you have to buy computers you have to teach teacher how to use computer you have to say at some teacher that are old that are learning some all of those teacher are not able to use computer because they learn school with books they are learn school with writing at the hand so thats mean that we need to change everything and i think its a little bit complicated in one second so we i agree with you with all what you said but we have to make a transition not to stop all of book and to pass all of computers
