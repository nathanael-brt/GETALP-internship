yes i agree but that is our work that is the teacher work and parents work we need to control the time that the child spend on the screen for example we can work only two hours a day on screen sorry screens at school and the parents can control the times when the child will come back at home so the child will not spend too much time on the screen and we can do like exercise like who seems like feedback to talk about what did you see on screen what did you think to make to share together with the children to have their feelings about the screen and to check if they are good with it
