yeah i agree its a bit expensive but i think we can manage to have state subsidies and grants so that we can buy some devices that can be useful for students for example interactive whiteboards they can help some students with difficulties to stay focus especially among students who have difficulties or in verge to drop out of school maybe a more technological way to make them learn is is more easier make it easier for them to learn or to stay focused at school
