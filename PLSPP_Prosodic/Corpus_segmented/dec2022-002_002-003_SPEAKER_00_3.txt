yeah but we can also make a kind of open space or coworking space in the school and where there will be some technological devices which can be used every time of the day and could permit to the students to work as they want with some teachers around who could look at what they are doing if its in link or not with the school and maybe put in place a system of card that they have to insert in a kind of box which will verify if they have already used in the day a computer and making some as you said filters and reducing the time of use per day for example to maximum one hour
