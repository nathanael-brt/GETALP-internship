well yeah bullying is one of the risks that is really evident with social media and the fact that students are using it more and more and that their parents are having problems regulating it because they dont really understand their principle so that is why we could also try and implement strict rules regarding their devices like an example was given of the fact that some teachers at the beginning of their classes used to ask questions to the students and it would be easier for students to answer on the forums online and to make sure that those forums are only parts of the school website for example and not used by everyone enforce a strict regulation regarding maybe curse words and make sure that there are filters etc
