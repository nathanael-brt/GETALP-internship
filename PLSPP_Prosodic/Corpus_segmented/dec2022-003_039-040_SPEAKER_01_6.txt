yes i think thats interesting and i agree with you they use screens and internet and computers all the time its a generation who was born with this and who knows it may be better than us and i think that we should learn them how to make good things and to use these computers and all these screens usefully we have to learn them how to make it good how to do good things with it how to use them and use them to help them like even in the work at work at school because now the children are using these screens and everything mostly to do not to work to divertissement and everything so i think its important to learn them how to work with it and how to make it useful
