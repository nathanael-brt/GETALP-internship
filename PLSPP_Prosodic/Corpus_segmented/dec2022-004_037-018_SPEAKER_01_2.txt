yes but if we make a good internet connection for example we can increase the skill of our students because we can make an evolution of our teaching like a teacher can give a subject to a student and a student with a good internet connection can make research about the subject and thats really great for the teaching and for the students and can add some interest for the students because some students cannot be interest by teaching on paper and pencil
