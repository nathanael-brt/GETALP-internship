i see but i hear also is that its a really expensive project like i said to buy the computers to keep them to keep the maintenance up everything i dont think every school every that the state has the money for that in every school and moreover when maintenance is needed you cant use the technology so it can also slow down the learning process while its in maintenance while computers or technologic devices are in maintenance they cant be used so it slows down the learning process
