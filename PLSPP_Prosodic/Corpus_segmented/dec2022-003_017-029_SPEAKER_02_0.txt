okay im gonna defend the fact that the school should moderate the use of the technology in the classroom because theres a lot of negative point about it like its not a good thing to be inscreen all day for a child because it s can develop anxiety and the child can become anger more usually and theyre not very concentrate when theyre on a screen no one can really watch what theyre doing in front of the screen so it can develop cyber harassment so its why it should be moderate
