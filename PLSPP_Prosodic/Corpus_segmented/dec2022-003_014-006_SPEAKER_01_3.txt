teachers who are now in the scholar system may not be born with the technologies so they need to learn more about how to control it how to use it etc and it could cost very much because you need to install a lot of computers to help every pupil because if you want to put this system to help every student everyone should be at the same level so everyone should have his home computer provided by the school if its possible and then it would be a so much expensive measure and then you need to hire a person to form the teachers how to use it and i think it could be so expensive for schools who are not who dont have a lot of money from the system
