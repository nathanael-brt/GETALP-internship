about the cost of the technologies i think personally if we make a good plan so we make a big invest first but we make a good update plan so we doesnt need to remake a big invest later and it can reduce the cost because we doesnt have to recruit to technology experts if a troubleshooting appears but yes their are some cost in maintenance etc
