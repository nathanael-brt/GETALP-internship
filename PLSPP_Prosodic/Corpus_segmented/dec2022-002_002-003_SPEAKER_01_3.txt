yeah thats a really interesting idea john its also a good idea because it can instil a combination of normal traditional ways of learning and also screens like some said a teacher said that she used kagan structures which is a form of cooperative learning moment and also because they had little book clubs etc so they would use computers and tablets to learn a little bit more but they also had things outside of screens by interacting with others and learning at the same time
