well yeah currently technology is a bit of a work in progress like you said technology has a real toll on mental health with anxiety low self esteem sometimes depression and yeah some are more advantaged because their parents for example have high incomes compared to others that dont really have access to computers because their parents cant afford to so like i said before try and regulate and also help by funding schools so that each student can be able to access computers in school and i think we should do that also because we have a lot of learning to do but also learning techniques are already present with technology like this topic of constructivism and inquirybased learning for example where students are taught to search for topics and teachers are there to guide them and it can help with independence constructing a train of thoughts answering questions and understanding instructions
