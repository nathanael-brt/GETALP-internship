yeah but maybe just for students who doesnt have the privilege to have a computer at home it could be a good opportunity for them to learn to use a computer at school because if they dont have it at home one day they will be in a firm where they will have to use a computer or software and hardware and they will not be able to do it so maybe especially for those children who are who lack technology at home maybe technology at school could help them
