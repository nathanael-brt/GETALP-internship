141		Okay. One for one will be one by five will be eight.
141		Okay. So this is about the article.
141		I suggest to provide more about the animal testing and other progress.
141		Yeah. Yeah. I understand what you said. I'm sure there was a lot of other things
141		we can talk about, but I think the main subject of the animal testing
141		is of the benefits we have thanks to. We can see of the medicine progress
141		and of the new treatment medication.
141		And I think there is a lot of things to say about it and it could be a good idea.
141		Oh, yeah. Right. But it can be an example, but there is so much other medication
141		that the treatment worked. And they have been doing, okay, they tried animal testing
141		and it made it done work with this one and it was more relevant
141		with other things that, like, I don't know, computer needed.
141		But this is, for the moment, the main, the most relevant practice
141		is my two progress in medicine study.
141		Yes. But as we can see, this is the one with the most.
141		We don't really have a lot of, like, I don't think.
141		We didn't work enough with other methods to be sure to take good one.
141		And this one, I don't think it's my kind of idea,
141		I think this one could be great for our article
141		and we maybe have much to say.
141		Yes, it would be great to talk about it for sure.
141		We need to give out the information to everybody and to give a better understanding of the today.
141		But this is not the biggest argument, you know, what I mean.
141		They need those information in the article
141		but to make today I keep my mind, it's that I'm noticing
141		and they put the argument about it.
141		Because, yeah, we have a lot of other methods, they work,
141		but we also have the, you know, these three are...
141		Yeah, and I think it's a good argument to animal-dating
141		because they change contents of the painful or the harmful they quote in faith to the animal
141		and they work with, but they still use the animal.
141		I think so, it's maybe a good compromise between them.
141		This is maybe something we can add on the article
141		like you have you already and I have my interview
141		and we can work both together, but I think we need to clarify each point
141		and it's a shade of grey and not everything is white or black.
141		Yeah, yeah, I think they tell them.
141		It's quite difficult.
141		If we give only your point of view, everybody will be proud.
141		We have to stop animal testing because this is the bad things.
141		We just lost money.
141		It's not relevant and we don't conclude anything
141		because we don't have good results or just any results.
141		But that's not true because we have some results
141		and we chose an animal testing.
141		It's for the moment the one who's working well
141		because we can still live like living cells.
141		And the interaction between them.
141		I can't say that in computer or anything.
141		I think this article can lead to a great information
141		and everybody can have their own opinion
141		with all the information.
141		And I think it's important.
155		Yeah. I don't really, I don't think that we can write the article all about the progress
155		about the animal testing because, like, they are not just progress about it.
155		Yeah. But the thing that you're talking about are not very relevant
155		and not always relevant because we have seen a lot of progress in animal testing.
155		Like, so, as during one, have you heard about this?
155		I read some researchers that were saying that in fact,
155		a lot of animal testing experiences were not finished
155		and they need to know where, like, we don't have the results of them.
155		A large number of animal testing experiences that have, you know,
155		benefits on our society or on medical research.
155		To my mind, this is not quite a thing to do in our article
155		because people are just there that I love this thing is good
155		and, like, the only thing, but it's not true at all.
155		There are a lot of alternative methods.
155		I know that sometimes alternative methods are not enough
155		but in many cases there are enough and we don't use them enough.
155		Yeah, these three are like a rule, but not everybody follows rules.
155		And I think we have to think twice about the fact that we are doing like animals belong to us
155		but animals don't belong to us.
155		They are just suffering in our laboratory and it's not like we are pretending
155		this is a right thing or we are not even thinking about it.
155		It's not a subject that we talk about.
155		We are pretending that it's okay, but I don't think so.
155		Yeah, I can agree on something with you.
155		But I think that for many years, your point of view has been showed
155		so I think it's a right thing to show my point of view.
155		Yeah, but if we also try the two of them.
155		So I heard what you are saying.
155		But I think so we can show your point of view.
155		But we can also say that it's in many situations
155		we can do without animal testing.
155		And if we need animal testing,
155		maybe we can think to hire less animal,
155		less animals and in better conditions.
155		And like in this motif, they are well-being.
155		They are well-being because...
155		If we are doing less animal testing,
155		we can do this in better conditions.
155		I think it's a good opportunity for the research service
155		because we will write a very interesting article
155		with our both point of view.
155		And I'm glad that we are working together.
Ens		Thank you very much.
