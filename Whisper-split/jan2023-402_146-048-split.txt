146		So I think for the news, for the article, we have to show that it's important to keep
146		the animal testing because we don't have choice to do some tests in medicines in another way.
146		So you want to speak in an objective way, or you want to give some arguments in the favour of animal testing?
146		I think I miss and understand myself, because I think we don't have the choice to have to keep the animal testing.
146		We don't have the other way, but you think we have to do not do this practice. Why?
146		Yes, but I think human life is better and more important than an animal life, and that's why we don't
146		test on a child or on a person who has a life where we're conscientious. Animals don't have
146		a conscience. They'll feel pain, yes, but they don't have a mind and a conscience and a
146		sophisticated mind, so we don't have the choice. We have to test the medicine in a tissue and
146		Yes, but today at the moment, when we talk, a many of work show that other way of testing are
146		not benefits and not very scientist. We have just a normal way of testing is animal, maybe in the
146		future, if we have the money, if we have the knowledge, we can't create just things of simulation
146		of the human body, but today it's so complicated, I don't know how to create a machine like that,
146		so I don't have the solution and so for me we have to keep the animal testing because I don't
146		know the way of construction, we have to build this kind of technology.
146		And so do you think that we can replace entirely animals because for me,
146		we are, even if we have some technologies like simulation, like computer, in the future,
146		we have to keep animals because it's the most, the most closer of human if we don't want to test on
146		human. Maybe you can reduce this number of animals, but not completely stop this kind of project.
146		Yes, but I disagree with that because that's supposed the fact that we have to create some biological
146		tissues like human tissue and that's supposed the fact we have to create new humans with
146		machines like Archifersially. So I think it's unichicol. For me, we have to keep
146		animal testing because yes, it's not it's unichicol, but the other way is also unichicol. So
146		it's just we have to reduce at the maximum the risk of suffering that it's very complicated situation.
146		I think we have to to show the two ways of thinking and make some tailoring for the future.
146		So thank you.
048		I agree with you on the fact that we have no other solution to stop animal testing,
048		but I don't think it's a good idea to speak for animal testing, but most against animal testing,
048		because if people with our article, I think it's important to show that this technique
048		hurts animals and can kill them.
048		I think it's not possible to speak about the favour of animal testing.
048		Because animals are also conscientious, like you and me, and in reality, I think you don't want to test some drugs,
048		some things which cause the earth to you and kill you.
048		biological tissue on animals. Yes, but okay, if you want, animals are not conscientious, but it's
048		a part of our world, of our biodiversity, of our environment, and it's very important to keep
048		their biodiversity in good way. So I think there are other solutions to test medical tests,
048		so it's not only the solution. You think about what the other way of testing, like new technologies
048		or just in other way of testing? New technology and other way, but new technology, we are in the
048		Soviet society, which are in increase and in developing, and all day we are new technology
048		and new things to increase the world, so we can find a solution to stop animal testing.
048		I'm a higher boy because the technology is not with the technology is not possible
048		today to stop animal testing, but in our article, I think it's important to say that
048		we have, they have a lot of research on technology to stop animal testing and we don't agree,
048		we disagree, we disagree with the fact of animal testing, but today we don't do with another solution.
048		In my mind, in the future, with the evolution of technology, it will completely
048		be possible, it will be completely possible to stop animal testing, not just reduce, but stop.
048		Because we have, today we invent a lot of things and I think if we take a little of a whole time
048		to think about this problem, I think we can find a solution for stop radically animal testing.
048		Okay, so for this article, I think with all of we say that this article should be objective,
048		talk about animal testing, the argument in favor of animal testing and against animal testing,
048		I think it's a good way and I think it's very important to talk about the new technology,
048		the new method to stop animal testing. Yeah, I think we have to, I agree with you for the start,
048		So thank you.
