093		93, okay and your role is A, okay thank you and my number is a number of 15 with a reward
093		So what do you want to start?
093		So for me I think that technology is a good thing for the education because the kids or the children can
093		just learn something, make it a little bit more fun with games or something like this.
093		I think that the school can make the...
093		Yeah I see what you want to say, but I think that the parents need also to take a student and place some boarder to him at home.
093		So we can make the school more fun for the children.
093		I think that the education needs to be with games or on board that the children can interact with.
093		The students can access to internet or something like this to add games in this project.
093		Yes, for the school can give to the students a computer or a tablet to do homework at home.
093		So this means that several students, including the low-income students, can have access to this digital tool.
093		And the teacher can make permission with the energy coach that can make the teacher more comfortable with the technology.
093		So now to ask you why there is a problem with the technology at the education?
093		I think that's for this problem we can have some money and just put the education technology in the years, like in 10 years.
093		So we can add just when the school parents, for example, where we just put the digital tools in the school.
093		I think that we can make the educational technology, but yes, we need to install some needs, like for example, one or two hours of the time screen per day.
093		And so we also need to make some tests in the program and make some tests in the classroom.
093		I think that's a good compromise for the program.
093		I think that can make a computer like you see them.
093		I think that's a big test to be on the power and to make the difference between technology and real test.
093		I think that's a better digital, if there is some restriction on the computer of my notebook, so the students can cheat at the test.
093		It's more comfortable for students to make information, digital tests about computer science.
093		Yes.
115		I found the technology is very deep, but team technology of addition to technology and screens devices.
115		So I don't find it's a really good idea to interrupt technology in school.
115		Okay but you don't know how to play games at home and play problems.
115		Yeah I agree with you.
115		What do you think about the form of education with technology?
115		Yes, but first you don't have a device to do homework at home. So do you have a solution for that?
115		What about teachers? They don't have training for this new technology?
115		I think it's a good idea, a good concept, but there is some issue with that, like the cost of the device and the cost of training teachers to that new technology.
115		I think we can finally compromise to the importance of technology in the classroom.
115		I think we can also technology in the classroom, but not all the day for all the week.
115		We need to keep a distance with the technology in the classroom to study the traditional way in the tiny paper.
115		Thank you.
115		I think some things can be made on a couple of days.
115		Yes, but it's from the technology.
115		Can you prefer an exam on paper or in digital?
115		I think the algorithm test will be in paper.
115		The prototype will be kind of tested.
115		We have something else to do.
115		I think we have the time to do the confirmation.
115		Thank you.
Ens		B. So start the timer when you're ready to 10 minutes with a ring at the end, okay.
Ens		Can you tell us the time please?
Ens		Would you like to say something else? Could you tell us three and a half minutes?
