005		0.5
005		0.05
005		and I'm role A
005		Okay, I understand your point of view
005		but today the technology is quite important
005		because we need
005		computer to access to websites
005		or things like this
005		and teacher has
005		to show things to the class
005		or things like this
005		I agree
005		but I think that
005		the technologies
005		should be the
005		development of new
005		way with new technologies
005		to learn
005		and to teach
005		for the kids
005		it's a
005		better way to
005		learn because
005		they are more
005		happy to be there
005		they enjoy
005		the class
005		and teachers
005		it's
005		more simple
005		because
005		they can
005		use a lot of things
005		and diversify
005		the
005		how they work
005		I agree with you
005		technology is
005		also
005		keyboard
005		or
005		the things
005		that can project an image
005		on the keyboard
005		and it's not just the computer
005		so if we invest
005		in the
005		research of new technology
005		we may
005		discover the new way
005		who
005		do not need to be on the
005		computer or
005		iPad or something like this
005		but who can
005		help the teacher
005		the government
005		who has to help
005		this school
005		and this teacher
005		and also the parents
005		because maybe
005		the child is
005		in a
005		great school
005		but he may
005		have no money
005		but it's a government
005		who has to help
005		the school
005		offer them the
005		opportunity to
005		buy new stuff
005		okay
005		but maybe we should
005		just talk about this
005		with the
005		governments
005		for communication
005		we try to
005		see what we can do
005		but I think that
005		even if we don't
005		know what the government
005		was going to say
005		we know that we have to
005		invest on your technology
005		because it's
005		too
005		important.
005		the government
005		will
005		choose to
005		invest.
005		it's an evidence
005		because there is too many
005		so many
005		how to say
005		that he
005		knows he has to do it
005		school need this for work, and work in a good way, because we saw that the child and the teacher are more
005		appears in the school when there is more technology.
005		Yes, I agree with you, because we all know that the screen is bad for everyone, not just children.
005		And we, it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you say.
005		So the teacher do this part, they have to adapt with the things that we offer today.
005		And so we just had to agree with the fact that we invest, and that's it.
005		Okay.
025		and I'm a candidate 0.25
025		and I'm a role B
025		So I personally think that new technologies
025		aren't any good in class
025		and it should be
025		something that is out of the school
025		and not in the school
025		Yes, of course
025		I hear this
025		but I think that
025		there are some studies
025		that show that
025		there are two
025		kind of
025		of a situation
025		I think there is a
025		when there
025		are
025		everyday new technologies
025		and it can
025		represent a distraction
025		and of course
025		on the other side
025		there can be
025		once a week a class
025		with computers
025		to learn new technologies
025		to the
025		Yes, but
025		we know
025		quite a time now
025		that the
025		device
025		is a great
025		huge
025		amount of time
025		like 6-8 hours
025		a day
025		so we do not need
025		to increase
025		this time
025		This is a good
025		point
025		if you want a new technology
025		in class this should be
025		with great equipment
025		not necessarily
025		a computer
025		but
025		there will be
025		some investment
025		that we need to do
025		and of course
025		there will be
025		an instruction of the teacher
025		because
025		not a teacher
025		knows how to use
025		keyboard or
025		computer
025		for their
025		course, for
025		mathematic, for example
025		there is
025		inequality between
025		school that has
025		the money for this
025		and school that
025		doesn't have. I know that and
025		I agree with you
025		so if the government
025		say that
025		you will invest in this
025		and of course
025		give money
025		to school that
025		doesn't have that much money
025		I can
025		eventually think
025		that some technology
025		has a certain level
025		with a
025		minimum amount of time
025		can be good
025		because
025		of course
025		this is not
025		all about
025		Yes, but
025		we have to invest
025		and to invest
025		in the future
025		that some people
025		like government
025		or
025		other kind of people
025		will help
025		and will do everything
025		they can
025		so there isn't any
025		inequality between
025		school and between students
025		because this is the future
025		sorry
025		this is the future
025		this was the
025		increase in equality
025		Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation, technology can be slowly,
025		actually integrate in a classroom, but with regulation, not every day, like once a week, for example,
025		to start, or like one hour a day or something like this.
025		So I agree with you.
