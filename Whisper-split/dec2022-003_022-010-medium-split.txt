022		Yes. My number is 022.
022		In my opinion, technology in class is very
022		hard and it's not good. We use pen and papers for long decades, blackboard, books. I'm
022		not interested in technology. It's successful.
022		Yes, but you see in all the exams that are passed in paper with pen,
022		we don't have tablets or computers in the exams.
022		write. I see, but for the students you talked before, you know some studies
022		spoke about it raises anxiety and reduces self-esteem. We could have issues of
022		addictivity of students. Many students use computer technology six to eight hours
022		a day. It's enough and we don't have to use it in classroom.
022		sleep if they don't use technology. I see your purpose, but the final point I want to
022		talk about is technology is very expensive. A lot of schools
022		do not have many income and technology is very expensive. How do you do with that?
022		paper and pen. I saw your purpose and why it's interesting. I'm ready to act to use
022		interactive whiteboard in classroom. Is it interesting the whiteboard or not?
022		Okay, so it's okay. We can show the supervisor to buy some interactive whiteboard.
010		And me it's 010.
010		In my opinion, I think technology is a good idea and it's also an actual subject.
010		So it can help a teacher to organize her lesson and also for students it can be
010		a way to make the lesson more interesting and more interactive. So I think it's a good idea.
010		Yes, but maybe we can do a part of technology and also a part of paper and
010		pen. So maybe the school can do during the year some exam for training the students to continue to
010		Maybe the school can organize a sensibilization of students to show the limits of technology.
010		Maybe they can show that the students can also read books and don't usually use technology
010		and also show the limit of time screen. For example, the nights when the students go to
010		I think the students that can pay for their computer can buy their own computer.
010		I think the school has to prepare a budget before and I don't have a real solution for the money.
010		I think maybe for the school who can not invest in a computer they have to keep the traditional
010		Yes, I think it's a good idea because the students can participate with this.
Ens		022?
Ens		010, okay.
