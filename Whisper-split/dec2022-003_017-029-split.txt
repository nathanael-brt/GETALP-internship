017		Yes, zero, one, seven.
017		You start.
017		How's your heart?
017		I personally think that have technology in classes, it's a new perspective of teaching,
017		and it enables students to be curious and search information online on topics they like.
017		And also, ecologically speaking, it's good for environment, because we don't have to use paper.
017		So I think it's quite good.
017		I'm listening to your point.
017		I think it has this topic of technology in classes as pros and cons,
017		and your telling and cons that is arsement.
017		But I think that things could be put to avoid arsement.
017		I don't have solutions.
017		I have mixed feelings about that, because I think that technology can allow children or students and teachers
017		to have a dialogue, another dialogue from the classics school.
017		I think also that now with the development of data, it's more practical.
017		To search online things than in books.
017		And how about the...
017		Oh, I don't know.
017		I don't know, but it's a road to do a certain...
017		How do you say?
017		You can follow the line.
017		I think it's great to have technology in school and at home because for children,
017		it's more practical and for teachers.
017		It's a new perspective to teach and it's interesting for them.
017		Yes.
017		The fact is that teachers in their childhood, in the last decade, weren't happy to use technology because it didn't exist.
017		But the thing is that they can now be coached and they can learn to...
017		No, I don't know how to proceed.
017		So we can find a compromise, a compromise, yes.
017		Yes.
017		I totally agree with you.
017		And I think one or two hours per day or per week, it's a good thing.
017		Yes.
017		Yes.
017		Yeah.
017		Both are perfect.
029		A roll, eight.
029		Zero, two, nine, and a whole bit.
029		Okay.
029		Two.
029		Okay.
029		I'm going to defend the fact that the school should remodelate the use of the technology
029		in the classroom, because there's a lot of negative points about it.
029		Like, it's not a good thing to be in-screen all day for a child, because it can develop
029		and anxiety and the child can become and go more usually.
029		And they're not very concentrated when they're on a screen.
029		No one can really watch what they're doing in front of the screen, so it can develop
029		a possible arsement, so it's why it should be in-moderate.
029		Well, what about the motivation of the use, because of the cyber arsement that can be made of?
029		But don't you think that people must not be very concentrated when they're not in front of the screen?
029		You know what I mean? When the teacher is speaking in a traditional way,
029		that you will think, okay, let's not be concentrated now and be concentrated on the screen because it's fun.
029		What about the anxiety, the anger, and all the negative points that the studies show of the screen?
029		Don't you think that a low children at home is usually on the screen, come to class?
029		Also, a screen is a good thing for the development of the side.
029		But what about the people who are not very...
029		Well, we don't really use the teacher, we don't really use the screen or everything.
029		And when you ask them to teach with the things that they didn't know how to use it.
029		Learn to...
029		I listen to what you are saying and I think that the screen is a good thing but it should be moderated.
029		It's not a no for me to be used at school but it should be moderated because of everything that is the consequence of the using of the screen.
029		Yeah.
029		And not no more.
029		It should be a...
029		The traditional way should be used.
029		And not only on the screen.
Ens		Can you roll?
Ens		And yours please?
Ens		Okay, when you're ready, you guys can begin.
Ens		You have eight minutes to ten minutes.
Ens		And this means you have one minute left.
Ens		You can begin now.
