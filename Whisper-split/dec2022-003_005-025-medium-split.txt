005		05.
005		005, and I'm role A.
005		Okay, I understand your point of view, but today the technology is quite important
005		because we need computer to access to websites or things like this,
005		and teachers need to show things to the class or things like this.
005		I agree, but I think that the foundation priorities should be the development of new way
005		with new technologies to learn and to teach for the kids.
005		It's a better way to learn because they are more happy to be there.
005		They enjoy the class.
005		And for the teachers, it's more simple because they can use a lot of things
005		and diversify how they work.
005		I agree with you, but technology is also a keyboard
005		or the things that can project an image on the keyboard.
005		And it's not just a computer, so if we invest in the research of new technology,
005		we may discover the new way.
005		We do not need to be on a computer or iPad or something like this,
005		but we can be a technology and help the teacher.
005		I know that, and actually it doesn't really concern us.
005		It's the government who has to help this school and this teacher,
005		and also the parents because maybe the child is in a great school,
005		but he may have no money.
005		But it's the government who has to help the school,
005		and we should offer them the opportunity to buy new stuff.
005		Okay, but maybe we should just talk about this with the government
005		for communication and try to see what we can do.
005		But I think that even if we don't know what the government was going to say,
005		we know that we have to invest on new technology because it's too important.
005		The government will choose to invest.
005		It's an evidence because there is too many...
005		He knows he has to do it because the school needs this for work
005		and work in a good way because we saw that the child
005		and the teacher are happiest in the school when there is more technology.
005		Yes, I agree with you because we all know that the screen is bad for everyone,
005		and it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you say.
005		So the teachers do this part, they have to adapt with the things that we offer to them.
005		So we just have to agree with the fact that we invest and that's it.
025		And I'm candidate 025, and I'm role B.
025		So I personally think that new technologies aren't any good in class,
025		and it should be something that is out of the school and not in the school.
025		Yes, of course, I hear this, but I think that there are some studies that show that
025		there are two kinds of situations, I think.
025		There is when there are everyday new technologies, and it can represent a distraction.
025		And of course, on the other side, there can be like once a week a class with computer
025		to learn new technologies to the student.
025		Yes, but we know for quite a time now that the amount of time that teens,
025		so students, pass on a device, like a smartphone, computer,
025		is a huge amount of time, like six to eight hours a day.
025		So we do not need to increase this time.
025		This is a good point, Moni.
025		If we want a new technology in class, this should be with great equipment, like you said,
025		not necessarily a computer per student,
025		but there will be some investment that we need to do.
025		And of course, there will be maybe instruction of teachers
025		because not all teachers know how to use a keyboard or computer for their course,
025		for mathematics, for example.
025		And so there is maybe inequality between a school that has the money for this
025		and a school that doesn't have.
025		I agree with you.
025		So if the government says that you will invest in this
025		and of course give money to a school that doesn't have that much money,
025		I can eventually think that some technology on a certain level
025		with a minimum amount of time can be good
025		because of course this is not all bad.
025		Yes, but we have to invest, but to invest we need to have money
025		and to make sure that some people like government or other kind of people
025		will help and will do everything they can
025		so there isn't any inequality between school and between students
025		because this is the future of the country.
025		So if some kids don't have the same education as others,
025		this will increase inequality.
025		Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation,
025		technology can be slowly integrated in the classroom,
025		but with regulation, like I said, not every day, like once a week for example,
025		to start or like one hour a day or something like this.
025		Yes, so I agree with you.
Ens		Your candidate number?
Ens		Your candidate number is 005.
Ens		Okay, you can begin.
