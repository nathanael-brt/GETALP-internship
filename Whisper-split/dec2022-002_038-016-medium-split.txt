038		So, 38, situation 1 and role B.
038		No, I disagree with you because I think it's more armed than good.
038		And schools should moderate using technology.
038		Indeed, social inequalities can be evocated because some students don't have the tools necessary
038		and don't have access to computers or the internet, for example.
038		So, I think it's not a good way to admit new technology in the classroom.
038		Yes, it's possible, but it's so expensive for the schools.
038		And the teacher must be formed and it's a major problem to develop new technologies.
038		It's so expensive for the schools and it increases inequalities.
038		Yes, I agree with you on this point.
038		But the risk is to disconnect the students with the reality.
038		And I think it's more better to read a book, for example, than to learn with a computer.
038		And for example, in some countries, students don't have the possibility to buy good equipment
038		and access of new technology increases social inequalities.
038		Yes, a little bit is a possibility.
038		And students pass exams, pass assessments, and the assessments were written.
038		So, I think it's possible to make...
038		Yes, but a little bit.
038		Yes, it's a good way to increase our knowledge.
038		Yes, one hour per day.
038		It's a good solution, I think.
038		And it's a good way to increase our capacity, our skills in different topics.
038		Yes, it's very beneficial. Benefits are good in this point.
038		Yes.
038		Yes, and each student can be access to a computer.
038		Can we also learn with a pen and a paper?
038		In class, yes, in school.
038		So, I think, like I already said, that school should moderate the using of technology.
038		And I think your proposition is very good for the students and the teacher.
038		No, it's perfect. Thank you.
016		Number 016, situation 1 and role A.
016		So, what do you think about the priorities that we can call B in the matter of technology in the classroom?
016		Do you think it's a good thing?
016		Because I think, in my opinion, if you include more technology in the classroom,
016		we are going to increase the knowledge and the skill of the students.
016		It's a way to discover a new method. What do you think about that?
016		Okay, and as you say, some students don't have access to the technology.
016		And do you think that if we put in class some computers and work just a little time at every class,
016		they can discover a new thing because they don't have it at their home?
016		Yes, I agree with you. It's very expensive and teachers need very good training.
016		But I think it's a way to increase the curiosity of children and students.
016		And it may be a way for them to study in a way more exciting and more interesting for them.
016		So, I think we need to find solutions.
016		There is not too much, but not at all.
016		What do you think?
016		Yes, but in the real life, when you have a job, a work, you need to know how to use a computer
016		because a lot of jobs are using computers for grading mail, do some studies.
016		So, I think it's not good if there is too much.
016		But they need a little bit every month or every day for increase their knowledge and skills for their future jobs.
016		So, which solution can we found together?
016		Some exercises, maybe, and some research.
016		Yes, and maybe it can be a good idea if they do some research in the Internet
016		for discovering a computer and how it's working, and maybe some exercises.
016		But as you say, tests are on a paper with a pen.
016		So, just a little bit for their curiosity and discovery.
016		Yes, and do you think it's a better solution if a teacher decided to do three hours of their courses on the computer
016		of maybe just an hour per day or three hours per month because they need?
016		So, I understand that they don't need very much, but not less.
016		Yes, I think change the way of the learning, not just on the board with exercise paper and books
016		that can attract students.
016		They can be more exciting to learning and more interesting on the courses.
016		And as you already said, it's very expensive.
016		So, maybe not a computer for every student, but some computers in the class,
016		and they can turn during three hours and some don't exercise on their papers and other on their computers.
016		Yes.
016		Maybe we don't give homework at home on a computer for a variety of inequalities, as you said,
016		but do some exercises in the school.
016		If I can conclude, maybe we can say that we are going to do many technologies in class,
016		three hours per day, but with rotations that are going to avoid the inequalities between students,
016		and they can increase their knowledge and skills.
016		Am I missing something?
