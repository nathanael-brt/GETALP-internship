041		0.41 and roll A. 0.27, roll B.
041		So in my opinion, it's necessary to develop the technology in high school and in every
041		high school because is that allowed to improve the knowledge of the students and it's
041		a good point for their future job and in studies in a university or something like that.
041		Yeah, but I think it's important to to block this gap between the different high school because
041		I'm agree with you. Everybody can have access to the technology student from poor high school or very good
041		high school. There is no difference for me. Everybody has the right to access all the technology
041		and it's necessary for me.
041		Yes, but for that, I think the state can make a decision to put the budget and allowed
041		the high school to have good technologies like computer, good system, informatics system, etc.
041		Maybe we can help this whole teacher with give them information and some teachers specialized
041		in informatics and new technology can help them to be formed from that new form of scholarship.
041		Yes, maybe it's difficult to spend a lot of time to be formed with new technology,
041		but it's dramatically dramatic because I think it's good for students
041		because they can help them to develop their abilities to resolve problems
041		and to improve their knowledge about this type of technology.
041		It's need to be framed maybe because there is good points and by points.
041		So we can not just drop this form of new system.
041		Just like that, we need to improve to inform everybody, students, teachers, everybody.
041		For the development of this new system, we can begin with one, for example, one hour per day
041		with computers and new technology, but keep going with the old method with paper and pen
041		because technology also has a limit because in my opinion, it's more easy to learn a lesson with paper or without a screen.
041		Yeah, I'm gonna read.
027		OK, but I understand what you say, but I think that it's not possible in all schools because
027		there are some schools who don't have the money to add new technologies in their schools.
027		It can be necessary, but if students didn't have a computer, their own computer,
027		how can they do their homework, for example?
027		OK, it's a good idea, but this is not the only problem. There is also about teachers
027		because some of them are not able to use new technologies.
027		Maybe they are old or they didn't understand very well.
027		Yes, but new technology is not easy and they need really a lot of time to really understand
027		how it works and it's not really, we don't have a lot of time to teach them how to use it.
027		Yes, but studies shows too that students who use new technology in school develop anxiety.
027		So it's not a...
027		To my opinion, we need to reduce the time the students spend on computers, television,
027		just to reduce this time because they spend too much time on this at home
027		and if they are on computer at school too, there will be too much time for them.
027		I think it's a problem. They need to return at paper and pen to write to read too.
027		I think we can close the deal just to add a little of new technology on class,
027		maybe one or two hour per day, but we can keep also traditional way to teach.
