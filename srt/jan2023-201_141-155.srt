1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay. One for one will be one by five will be eight.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay. So this is about the article.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I suggest to provide more about the animal testing and other progress.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah. I don't really, I don't think that we can write the article all about the progress

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:04,000
about the animal testing because, like, they are not just progress about it.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah. Yeah. I understand what you said. I'm sure there was a lot of other things

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we can talk about, but I think the main subject of the animal testing

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
is of the benefits we have thanks to. We can see of the medicine progress

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and of the new treatment medication.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And I think there is a lot of things to say about it and it could be a good idea.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah. But the thing that you're talking about are not very relevant

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and not always relevant because we have seen a lot of progress in animal testing.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Like, so, as during one, have you heard about this?

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, yeah. Right. But it can be an example, but there is so much other medication

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that the treatment worked. And they have been doing, okay, they tried animal testing

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and it made it done work with this one and it was more relevant

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
with other things that, like, I don't know, computer needed.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But this is, for the moment, the main, the most relevant practice

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
is my two progress in medicine study.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I read some researchers that were saying that in fact,

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
a lot of animal testing experiences were not finished

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and they need to know where, like, we don't have the results of them.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
A large number of animal testing experiences that have, you know,

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
benefits on our society or on medical research.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes. But as we can see, this is the one with the most.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We don't really have a lot of, like, I don't think.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We didn't work enough with other methods to be sure to take good one.

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And this one, I don't think it's my kind of idea,

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I think this one could be great for our article

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and we maybe have much to say.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
To my mind, this is not quite a thing to do in our article

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
because people are just there that I love this thing is good

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and, like, the only thing, but it's not true at all.

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There are a lot of alternative methods.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I know that sometimes alternative methods are not enough

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
but in many cases there are enough and we don't use them enough.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, it would be great to talk about it for sure.

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We need to give out the information to everybody and to give a better understanding of the today.

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But this is not the biggest argument, you know, what I mean.

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They need those information in the article

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
but to make today I keep my mind, it's that I'm noticing

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and they put the argument about it.

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Because, yeah, we have a lot of other methods, they work,

44
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but we also have the, you know, these three are...

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah, and I think it's a good argument to animal-dating

46
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:26,000
because they change contents of the painful or the harmful they quote in faith to the animal

47
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and they work with, but they still use the animal.

48
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I think so, it's maybe a good compromise between them.

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, these three are like a rule, but not everybody follows rules.

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And I think we have to think twice about the fact that we are doing like animals belong to us

51
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
but animals don't belong to us.

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:06,000
They are just suffering in our laboratory and it's not like we are pretending

53
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
this is a right thing or we are not even thinking about it.

54
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's not a subject that we talk about.

55
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We are pretending that it's okay, but I don't think so.

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is maybe something we can add on the article

57
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
like you have you already and I have my interview

58
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and we can work both together, but I think we need to clarify each point

59
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and it's a shade of grey and not everything is white or black.

60
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah, I can agree on something with you.

61
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But I think that for many years, your point of view has been showed

62
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
so I think it's a right thing to show my point of view.

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, but if we also try the two of them.

64
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, yeah, I think they tell them.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's quite difficult.

66
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If we give only your point of view, everybody will be proud.

67
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We have to stop animal testing because this is the bad things.

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We just lost money.

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's not relevant and we don't conclude anything

70
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
because we don't have good results or just any results.

71
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But that's not true because we have some results

72
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
and we chose an animal testing.

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's for the moment the one who's working well

74
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
because we can still live like living cells.

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And the interaction between them.

76
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't say that in computer or anything.

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So I heard what you are saying.

78
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But I think so we can show your point of view.

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But we can also say that it's in many situations

80
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
we can do without animal testing.

81
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And if we need animal testing,

82
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
maybe we can think to hire less animal,

83
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
less animals and in better conditions.

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And like in this motif, they are well-being.

85
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They are well-being because...

86
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If we are doing less animal testing,

87
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
we can do this in better conditions.

88
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think this article can lead to a great information

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
and everybody can have their own opinion

90
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
with all the information.

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think it's a good opportunity for the research service

92
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
because we will write a very interesting article

93
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
with our both point of view.

94
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I'm glad that we are working together.

95
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And I think it's important.

96
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you very much.
