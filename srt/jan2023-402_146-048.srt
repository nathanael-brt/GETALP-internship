1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,640
So I think for the news, for the article, we have to show that it's important to keep

2
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:38,800
the animal testing because we don't have choice to do some tests in medicines in another way.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:54,720
I agree with you on the fact that we have no other solution to stop animal testing,

4
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:08,560
but I don't think it's a good idea to speak for animal testing, but most against animal testing,

5
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:26,160
because if people with our article, I think it's important to show that this technique

6
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,840
hurts animals and can kill them.

7
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:43,840
So you want to speak in an objective way, or you want to give some arguments in the favour of animal testing?

8
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:55,120
I think it's not possible to speak about the favour of animal testing.

9
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:06,800
I think I miss and understand myself, because I think we don't have the choice to have to keep the animal testing.

10
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:15,360
We don't have the other way, but you think we have to do not do this practice. Why?

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:28,960
Because animals are also conscientious, like you and me, and in reality, I think you don't want to test some drugs,

12
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:37,520
some things which cause the earth to you and kill you.

13
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:49,760
Yes, but I think human life is better and more important than an animal life, and that's why we don't

14
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:58,080
test on a child or on a person who has a life where we're conscientious. Animals don't have

15
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,160
a conscience. They'll feel pain, yes, but they don't have a mind and a conscience and a

16
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:14,160
sophisticated mind, so we don't have the choice. We have to test the medicine in a tissue and

17
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:27,200
biological tissue on animals. Yes, but okay, if you want, animals are not conscientious, but it's

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:35,920
a part of our world, of our biodiversity, of our environment, and it's very important to keep

19
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:55,920
their biodiversity in good way. So I think there are other solutions to test medical tests,

20
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:10,560
so it's not only the solution. You think about what the other way of testing, like new technologies

21
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,280
or just in other way of testing? New technology and other way, but new technology, we are in the

22
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:32,080
Soviet society, which are in increase and in developing, and all day we are new technology

23
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:41,360
and new things to increase the world, so we can find a solution to stop animal testing.

24
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:54,400
Yes, but today at the moment, when we talk, a many of work show that other way of testing are

25
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:04,400
not benefits and not very scientist. We have just a normal way of testing is animal, maybe in the

26
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:14,800
future, if we have the money, if we have the knowledge, we can't create just things of simulation

27
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:24,880
of the human body, but today it's so complicated, I don't know how to create a machine like that,

28
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:34,000
so I don't have the solution and so for me we have to keep the animal testing because I don't

29
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,760
know the way of construction, we have to build this kind of technology.

30
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:54,960
I'm a higher boy because the technology is not with the technology is not possible

31
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:04,960
today to stop animal testing, but in our article, I think it's important to say that

32
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:16,000
we have, they have a lot of research on technology to stop animal testing and we don't agree,

33
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:29,840
we disagree, we disagree with the fact of animal testing, but today we don't do with another solution.

34
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:39,680
And so do you think that we can replace entirely animals because for me,

35
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:50,240
we are, even if we have some technologies like simulation, like computer, in the future,

36
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:59,120
we have to keep animals because it's the most, the most closer of human if we don't want to test on

37
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:09,120
human. Maybe you can reduce this number of animals, but not completely stop this kind of project.

38
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:23,520
In my mind, in the future, with the evolution of technology, it will completely

39
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:34,320
be possible, it will be completely possible to stop animal testing, not just reduce, but stop.

40
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:45,760
Because we have, today we invent a lot of things and I think if we take a little of a whole time

41
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:56,800
to think about this problem, I think we can find a solution for stop radically animal testing.

42
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:07,360
Yes, but I disagree with that because that's supposed the fact that we have to create some biological

43
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,720
tissues like human tissue and that's supposed the fact we have to create new humans with

44
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:23,680
machines like Archifersially. So I think it's unichicol. For me, we have to keep

45
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,480
animal testing because yes, it's not it's unichicol, but the other way is also unichicol. So

46
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:41,920
it's just we have to reduce at the maximum the risk of suffering that it's very complicated situation.

47
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:58,880
Okay, so for this article, I think with all of we say that this article should be objective,

48
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:10,480
talk about animal testing, the argument in favor of animal testing and against animal testing,

49
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:20,000
I think it's a good way and I think it's very important to talk about the new technology,

50
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,640
the new method to stop animal testing. Yeah, I think we have to, I agree with you for the start,

51
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:36,640
I think we have to to show the two ways of thinking and make some tailoring for the future.

52
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,840
So thank you.
