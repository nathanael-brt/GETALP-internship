1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, my number is 022 and meets 010.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
010.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
OK.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In my opinion, technology in class is very home and it's not good.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We use pen and papers for long decades, blackboard, books.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not interested in technology.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's a success, Roland.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In my opinion, I think technology is a good idea and it's also an actual subject.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So it can help her teacher to organize her lesson.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And also for students, it can make the lesson more interesting and more interactive.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So I think it's a good idea.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes, but you see all the exams are passed in paper with pen.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We don't have tablets or computer in the exams.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes, but maybe we can do a part of technology and also a part of paper and pen.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So maybe the school can do during the year some exam for training the students to continue to write.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I see, but for the students you talk before you know some studies spoke about

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
it raised anxiety and reduced self-esteem.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We could have issues of additivity of students.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Many students use the computer or the technology six to eight hours a day.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's an often we don't have to use it in classroom.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Maybe the school can organize a sensibilization of students to show that

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to show the limits of technology, maybe like they can show that the students can also learn

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:51,000
read books and doesn't usually use the technology and also shows the limit of time screen.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:02,000
For example, the nights when the students go to sleep if they have to

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
do not use the technology or screen.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, yes, thank you.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I see a purpose, but the final point I want to talk about is technology is very expensive.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A lot of schools do not have many income and technology is very expensive.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How do you do with that?

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I think the students that can pay for their computer can buy their own computer.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I think the schools have to prepare their budget before and I don't have a real solution for the money.

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think maybe for the school we can not invest in the computer, have to keep the traditional paper and pen.

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I saw your purpose and why it's interesting.

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I wanted to use interactive whiteboard in classroom.

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It is very interesting, whiteboard or not.

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, yes, I think it's a good idea.

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Because the students can participate with this?

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yes, it's okay.

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We can sort the supervisor to buy some interactive whiteboard.
