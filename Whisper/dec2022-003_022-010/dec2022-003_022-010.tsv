0	8000	Yes, my number is 022 and meets 010.
8000	9000	010.
9000	12000	OK.
12000	19000	In my opinion, technology in class is very home and it's not good.
19000	26000	We use pen and papers for long decades, blackboard, books.
26000	30000	I'm not interested in technology.
30000	33000	It's a success, Roland.
33000	41000	In my opinion, I think technology is a good idea and it's also an actual subject.
41000	48000	So it can help her teacher to organize her lesson.
48000	60000	And also for students, it can make the lesson more interesting and more interactive.
60000	63000	So I think it's a good idea.
63000	70000	Yes, but you see all the exams are passed in paper with pen.
70000	74000	We don't have tablets or computer in the exams.
74000	87000	Yes, but maybe we can do a part of technology and also a part of paper and pen.
87000	101000	So maybe the school can do during the year some exam for training the students to continue to write.
101000	111000	I see, but for the students you talk before you know some studies spoke about
111000	115000	it raised anxiety and reduced self-esteem.
115000	121000	We could have issues of additivity of students.
121000	128000	Many students use the computer or the technology six to eight hours a day.
128000	134000	It's an often we don't have to use it in classroom.
134000	144000	Maybe the school can organize a sensibilization of students to show that
144000	154000	to show the limits of technology, maybe like they can show that the students can also learn
154000	171000	read books and doesn't usually use the technology and also shows the limit of time screen.
171000	182000	For example, the nights when the students go to sleep if they have to
182000	189000	do not use the technology or screen.
189000	192000	Yes, yes, thank you.
192000	202000	I see a purpose, but the final point I want to talk about is technology is very expensive.
202000	210000	A lot of schools do not have many income and technology is very expensive.
210000	215000	How do you do with that?
216000	233000	I think the students that can pay for their computer can buy their own computer.
234000	249000	I think the schools have to prepare their budget before and I don't have a real solution for the money.
249000	267000	I think maybe for the school we can not invest in the computer, have to keep the traditional paper and pen.
267000	274000	I saw your purpose and why it's interesting.
274000	280000	I wanted to use interactive whiteboard in classroom.
280000	285000	It is very interesting, whiteboard or not.
285000	289000	Yes, yes, I think it's a good idea.
289000	297000	Because the students can participate with this?
297000	301000	Yes, it's okay.
301000	309000	We can sort the supervisor to buy some interactive whiteboard.
