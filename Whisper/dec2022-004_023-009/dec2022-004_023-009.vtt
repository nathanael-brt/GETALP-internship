00:00.000 --> 00:23.000
So we are here to different our position on the foundation which is that could be in

00:23.000 --> 00:30.000
a better technology in the classroom. For me, I think that technology in school could

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
harm more than be good for students. For me schools should be moderated their

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
utilization of new technology.

00:39.000 --> 00:56.000
Okay, so in my opinion the technology in school is not harm but is like an experience

00:56.000 --> 01:13.000
and a thing to improve the learning of these students and the express of these students.

01:13.000 --> 01:22.000
Okay, I understand you point of view but for me I think that it could improve their

01:22.000 --> 01:29.000
capacities but it also could distract them where they are in class and they just look

01:29.000 --> 01:39.000
at the screen and for me and for therapists also students and young people are already

01:39.000 --> 01:48.000
too much in front of a screen. We can heard before that they are six or eight hours per day

01:48.000 --> 01:58.000
in front of a screen and if new technologies are allowed in school we couldn't

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
reduce this screen time.

02:01.000 --> 02:24.000
Okay, I could consider eight that can distract students but I think the students

02:24.000 --> 02:36.000
are wondering the learn and they can be more, I don't know, but...

02:36.000 --> 02:45.000
Do you think that technologies can interest students more than if they are just with a pen?

02:45.000 --> 02:58.000
Yes, it's like they are in her house and it's more familiar for him to take

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
technologies and to simply learn.

03:02.000 --> 03:13.000
Yeah, I couldn't agree more with you in this point and I think we can have a compromise

03:13.000 --> 03:24.000
with this. For me I think that a little time of screen in school couldn't have

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
bad effect on the students because they have to live with their time but I think

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
school should moderate their use.

03:37.000 --> 03:46.000
Yes, they need to restrict the time of the students in the screen because I think

03:46.000 --> 04:03.000
the students can be more able to deal with if they have a good situation

04:03.000 --> 04:12.000
and to use it.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Okay, yeah, I agree with you.

04:15.000 --> 04:24.000
And for you, what is the perfect time in the day for students?

04:24.000 --> 04:33.000
I think that's half an hour for day, it's a good time for students because

04:33.000 --> 04:46.000
extend this time the students were not concentrated in the school.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
Yeah, I agree with you with that.

04:49.000 --> 04:59.000
And I also think that if there are more than one or two hours per day in front of a screen like

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
the therapist, I agree with this.

05:05.000 --> 05:16.000
Students could have a addiction to technologies and their screen and their phone.

05:16.000 --> 05:26.000
Yes, my meanwhile the school, some students have an addiction with the screen.

05:26.000 --> 05:36.000
And the school didn't under the phone.

05:36.000 --> 05:46.000
And the school have a goal and this goal is to learn.

05:46.000 --> 05:58.000
And I think that's the learning can be passed with the screen with technology.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
But it's not the only goal of school.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
It's not the school of technology, it's school.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
So it's school to learn not to disrespect.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah, I agree with you on this.

06:18.000 --> 06:32.000
And to talk about another point, what do you think technology could do between students

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
who don't have a lot of money and don't have access to technologies.

06:38.000 --> 06:46.000
And the students who already had a phone, a computer and others.

06:46.000 --> 06:56.000
I think it's great disparities between a school who have technology who have technology.

06:56.000 --> 07:14.000
And these disparities need to be put, not protected, but limited, I think.

07:14.000 --> 07:35.000
Because if we create disparities, we need to involve the fact that we can have people with or not technology.

07:35.000 --> 07:50.000
And it's simply to school to create an environment for Android technology and school.

07:50.000 --> 08:01.000
And not just for show us the disparity between this person or this person who have technology and who haven't.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah, yeah, I understand what you just said.

08:05.000 --> 08:15.000
So to sum up, we agreed that one hour of technology and screen per day in school, it's okay.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
It's not too much.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
It's a good condition for students, I think.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
And to conclude, yes, technology is create disparities.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.000
But it also creates good moments for students.

08:33.000 --> 08:41.000
And they can just enjoy to stand up for in school.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
And that's my point.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Okay, I agree with you on this.
