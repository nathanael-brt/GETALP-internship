0	23000	So we are here to different our position on the foundation which is that could be in
23000	30000	a better technology in the classroom. For me, I think that technology in school could
30000	36000	harm more than be good for students. For me schools should be moderated their
36000	39000	utilization of new technology.
39000	56000	Okay, so in my opinion the technology in school is not harm but is like an experience
56000	73000	and a thing to improve the learning of these students and the express of these students.
73000	82000	Okay, I understand you point of view but for me I think that it could improve their
82000	89000	capacities but it also could distract them where they are in class and they just look
89000	99000	at the screen and for me and for therapists also students and young people are already
99000	108000	too much in front of a screen. We can heard before that they are six or eight hours per day
108000	118000	in front of a screen and if new technologies are allowed in school we couldn't
118000	121000	reduce this screen time.
121000	144000	Okay, I could consider eight that can distract students but I think the students
144000	156000	are wondering the learn and they can be more, I don't know, but...
156000	165000	Do you think that technologies can interest students more than if they are just with a pen?
165000	178000	Yes, it's like they are in her house and it's more familiar for him to take
178000	182000	technologies and to simply learn.
182000	193000	Yeah, I couldn't agree more with you in this point and I think we can have a compromise
193000	204000	with this. For me I think that a little time of screen in school couldn't have
204000	211000	bad effect on the students because they have to live with their time but I think
211000	217000	school should moderate their use.
217000	226000	Yes, they need to restrict the time of the students in the screen because I think
226000	243000	the students can be more able to deal with if they have a good situation
243000	252000	and to use it.
252000	255000	Okay, yeah, I agree with you.
255000	264000	And for you, what is the perfect time in the day for students?
264000	273000	I think that's half an hour for day, it's a good time for students because
273000	286000	extend this time the students were not concentrated in the school.
286000	289000	Yeah, I agree with you with that.
289000	299000	And I also think that if there are more than one or two hours per day in front of a screen like
299000	305000	the therapist, I agree with this.
305000	316000	Students could have a addiction to technologies and their screen and their phone.
316000	326000	Yes, my meanwhile the school, some students have an addiction with the screen.
326000	336000	And the school didn't under the phone.
336000	346000	And the school have a goal and this goal is to learn.
346000	358000	And I think that's the learning can be passed with the screen with technology.
358000	364000	But it's not the only goal of school.
364000	369000	It's not the school of technology, it's school.
369000	374000	So it's school to learn not to disrespect.
374000	378000	Yeah, I agree with you on this.
378000	392000	And to talk about another point, what do you think technology could do between students
392000	398000	who don't have a lot of money and don't have access to technologies.
398000	406000	And the students who already had a phone, a computer and others.
406000	416000	I think it's great disparities between a school who have technology who have technology.
416000	434000	And these disparities need to be put, not protected, but limited, I think.
434000	455000	Because if we create disparities, we need to involve the fact that we can have people with or not technology.
455000	470000	And it's simply to school to create an environment for Android technology and school.
470000	481000	And not just for show us the disparity between this person or this person who have technology and who haven't.
481000	485000	Yeah, yeah, I understand what you just said.
485000	495000	So to sum up, we agreed that one hour of technology and screen per day in school, it's okay.
495000	497000	It's not too much.
497000	501000	It's a good condition for students, I think.
501000	507000	And to conclude, yes, technology is create disparities.
507000	513000	But it also creates good moments for students.
513000	521000	And they can just enjoy to stand up for in school.
521000	524000	And that's my point.
524000	526000	Okay, I agree with you on this.
