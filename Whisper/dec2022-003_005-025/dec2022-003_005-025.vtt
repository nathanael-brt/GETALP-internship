WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You can do that number?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
0.5

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
0.05

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
0.05

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
and I'm role A

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
and I'm a candidate 0.25

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
and I'm a role B

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay, you can begin

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
So I personally think that new technologies

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
aren't any good in class

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
and it should be

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
something that is out of the school

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
and not in the school

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
Okay, I understand your point of view

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
but today the technology is quite important

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
because we need

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
computer to access to websites

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
or things like this

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
and teacher has

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
to show things to the class

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
or things like this

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes, of course

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I hear this

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
but I think that

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
there are some studies

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
that show that

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
there are two

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
kind of

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
of a situation

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I think there is a

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
when there

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
are

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
everyday new technologies

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
and it can

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
represent a distraction

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
and of course

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
on the other side

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
there can be

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
once a week a class

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
with computers

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
to learn new technologies

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
to the

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I agree

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
but I think that

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
the technologies

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
should be the

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
development of new

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
way with new technologies

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
to learn

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
and to teach

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
for the kids

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
it's a

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
better way to

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
learn because

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
they are more

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
happy to be there

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
they enjoy

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
the class

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
and teachers

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
it's

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
more simple

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
because

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
they can

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
use a lot of things

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
and diversify

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
the

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
how they work

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Yes, but

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
we know

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
quite a time now

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
that the

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
device

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
is a great

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
huge

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
amount of time

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
like 6-8 hours

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
a day

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
so we do not need

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
to increase

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
this time

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I agree with you

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
technology is

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
also

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
keyboard

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
or

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
the things

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
that can project an image

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
on the keyboard

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
and it's not just the computer

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
so if we invest

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
in the

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
research of new technology

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
we may

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
discover the new way

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
who

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
do not need to be on the

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
computer or

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
iPad or something like this

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
but who can

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
help the teacher

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
This is a good

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
point

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
if you want a new technology

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
in class this should be

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
with great equipment

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
not necessarily

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
a computer

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
but

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
there will be

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
some investment

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
that we need to do

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
and of course

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
there will be

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
an instruction of the teacher

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
because

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
not a teacher

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
knows how to use

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
keyboard or

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
computer

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
for their

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
course, for

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
mathematic, for example

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
there is

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
inequality between

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
school that has

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
the money for this

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
and school that

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
doesn't have. I know that and

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
the government

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
who has to help

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
this school

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
and this teacher

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
and also the parents

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
because maybe

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
the child is

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
in a

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
great school

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
but he may

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
have no money

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
but it's a government

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
who has to help

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
the school

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
offer them the

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
opportunity to

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
buy new stuff

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I agree with you

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
so if the government

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
say that

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
you will invest in this

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
and of course

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
give money

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
to school that

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
doesn't have that much money

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I can

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
eventually think

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
that some technology

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
has a certain level

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
with a

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
minimum amount of time

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
can be good

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
because

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
of course

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
this is not

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
all about

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
okay

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
but maybe we should

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
just talk about this

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
with the

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
governments

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
for communication

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
we try to

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
see what we can do

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
but I think that

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
even if we don't

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
know what the government

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
was going to say

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
we know that we have to

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
invest on your technology

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
because it's

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
too

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
important.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Yes, but

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
we have to invest

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
and to invest

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
in the future

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
that some people

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
like government

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
or

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
other kind of people

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
will help

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
and will do everything

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
they can

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
so there isn't any

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
inequality between

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
school and between students

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
because this is the future

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
sorry

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
this is the future

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
this was the

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
increase in equality

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
the government

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
will

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
choose to

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
invest.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
it's an evidence

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
because there is too many

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
so many

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
how to say

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
that he

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
knows he has to do it

07:24.000 --> 07:35.360
school need this for work, and work in a good way, because we saw that the child and the teacher are more

07:35.360 --> 07:46.360
appears in the school when there is more technology.

07:46.360 --> 07:59.360
Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation, technology can be slowly,

07:59.360 --> 08:09.360
actually integrate in a classroom, but with regulation, not every day, like once a week, for example,

08:09.360 --> 08:14.360
to start, or like one hour a day or something like this.

08:14.360 --> 08:24.360
Yes, I agree with you, because we all know that the screen is bad for everyone, not just children.

08:24.360 --> 08:32.360
And we, it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you say.

08:32.360 --> 08:42.360
So the teacher do this part, they have to adapt with the things that we offer today.

08:42.360 --> 08:51.360
And so we just had to agree with the fact that we invest, and that's it.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.360
So I agree with you.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.360
Okay.
