1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You can do that number?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
0.5

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
0.05

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
0.05

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and I'm role A

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and I'm a candidate 0.25

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and I'm a role B

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay, you can begin

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I personally think that new technologies

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
aren't any good in class

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and it should be

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
something that is out of the school

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and not in the school

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, I understand your point of view

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but today the technology is quite important

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
because we need

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
computer to access to websites

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
or things like this

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and teacher has

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to show things to the class

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
or things like this

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, of course

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I hear this

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but I think that

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
there are some studies

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that show that

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
there are two

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
kind of

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
of a situation

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I think there is a

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
when there

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
are

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
everyday new technologies

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and it can

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
represent a distraction

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and of course

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
on the other side

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
there can be

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
once a week a class

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
with computers

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to learn new technologies

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
to the

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I agree

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but I think that

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the technologies

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
should be the

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
development of new

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
way with new technologies

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to learn

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and to teach

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
for the kids

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
it's a

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
better way to

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
learn because

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
they are more

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
happy to be there

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
they enjoy

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
the class

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and teachers

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
it's

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
more simple

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
because

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
they can

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
use a lot of things

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and diversify

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
how they work

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, but

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
we know

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
quite a time now

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
that the

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
device

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
is a great

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
huge

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
amount of time

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
like 6-8 hours

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
a day

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so we do not need

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
to increase

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
this time

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I agree with you

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
technology is

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
also

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
keyboard

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
or

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the things

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
that can project an image

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
on the keyboard

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and it's not just the computer

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
so if we invest

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
in the

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
research of new technology

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
we may

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
discover the new way

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
who

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
do not need to be on the

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
computer or

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
iPad or something like this

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
but who can

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
help the teacher

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is a good

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
point

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
if you want a new technology

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
in class this should be

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
with great equipment

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
not necessarily

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
a computer

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
but

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
there will be

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
some investment

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that we need to do

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and of course

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
there will be

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
an instruction of the teacher

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
because

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
not a teacher

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
knows how to use

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
keyboard or

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
computer

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
for their

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
course, for

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
mathematic, for example

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
there is

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
inequality between

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
school that has

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the money for this

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and school that

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
doesn't have. I know that and

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the government

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
who has to help

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
this school

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and this teacher

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and also the parents

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
because maybe

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the child is

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
in a

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
great school

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
but he may

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
have no money

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
but it's a government

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
who has to help

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the school

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
offer them the

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
opportunity to

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
buy new stuff

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I agree with you

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
so if the government

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
say that

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you will invest in this

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and of course

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
give money

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to school that

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
doesn't have that much money

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
eventually think

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that some technology

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
has a certain level

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
with a

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
minimum amount of time

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
can be good

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
because

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
of course

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
this is not

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
all about

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
okay

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but maybe we should

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
just talk about this

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
with the

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
governments

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
for communication

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
we try to

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
see what we can do

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
but I think that

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
even if we don't

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
know what the government

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
was going to say

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
we know that we have to

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
invest on your technology

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
because it's

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
too

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
important.

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes, but

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
we have to invest

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
and to invest

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
in the future

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
that some people

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
like government

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
or

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
other kind of people

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
will help

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and will do everything

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
they can

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
so there isn't any

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
inequality between

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
school and between students

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
because this is the future

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
sorry

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
this is the future

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
this was the

200
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
increase in equality

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
the government

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
will

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
choose to

204
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
invest.

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
it's an evidence

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
because there is too many

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
so many

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
how to say

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that he

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
knows he has to do it

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,360
school need this for work, and work in a good way, because we saw that the child and the teacher are more

212
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:46,360
appears in the school when there is more technology.

213
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation, technology can be slowly,

214
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:09,360
actually integrate in a classroom, but with regulation, not every day, like once a week, for example,

215
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,360
to start, or like one hour a day or something like this.

216
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Yes, I agree with you, because we all know that the screen is bad for everyone, not just children.

217
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:32,360
And we, it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you say.

218
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:42,360
So the teacher do this part, they have to adapt with the things that we offer today.

219
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:51,360
And so we just had to agree with the fact that we invest, and that's it.

220
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
So I agree with you.

221
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Okay.
