0	2000	You can do that number?
2000	4000	0.5
4000	6000	0.05
6000	8000	0.05
8000	10000	and I'm role A
10000	12000	and I'm a candidate 0.25
12000	14000	and I'm a role B
14000	16000	Okay, you can begin
18000	24000	So I personally think that new technologies
24000	26000	aren't any good in class
26000	28000	and it should be
28000	32000	something that is out of the school
32000	34000	and not in the school
34000	38000	Okay, I understand your point of view
38000	44000	but today the technology is quite important
44000	46000	because we need
46000	50000	computer to access to websites
50000	52000	or things like this
52000	54000	and teacher has
54000	60000	to show things to the class
60000	62000	or things like this
62000	64000	Yes, of course
64000	66000	I hear this
66000	68000	but I think that
68000	70000	there are some studies
70000	72000	that show that
72000	74000	there are two
74000	76000	kind of
76000	78000	of a situation
78000	80000	I think there is a
80000	82000	when there
82000	84000	are
84000	86000	everyday new technologies
86000	88000	and it can
88000	90000	represent a distraction
90000	92000	and of course
92000	94000	on the other side
94000	96000	there can be
96000	98000	once a week a class
98000	100000	with computers
100000	102000	to learn new technologies
102000	104000	to the
104000	106000	I agree
106000	108000	but I think that
108000	110000	the technologies
110000	112000	should be the
112000	114000	development of new
114000	116000	way with new technologies
116000	118000	to learn
118000	120000	and to teach
120000	122000	for the kids
122000	124000	it's a
124000	126000	better way to
126000	128000	learn because
128000	130000	they are more
130000	132000	happy to be there
132000	134000	they enjoy
134000	136000	the class
136000	138000	and teachers
138000	140000	it's
140000	142000	more simple
142000	144000	because
144000	146000	they can
146000	148000	use a lot of things
148000	150000	and diversify
150000	152000	the
152000	154000	how they work
154000	156000	Yes, but
156000	158000	we know
158000	160000	quite a time now
160000	162000	that the
162000	164000	device
164000	166000	is a great
166000	168000	huge
168000	170000	amount of time
170000	172000	like 6-8 hours
172000	174000	a day
174000	176000	so we do not need
176000	178000	to increase
178000	180000	this time
180000	182000	I agree with you
182000	184000	technology is
184000	186000	also
186000	188000	keyboard
188000	190000	or
190000	192000	the things
192000	194000	that can project an image
194000	196000	on the keyboard
196000	198000	and it's not just the computer
198000	200000	so if we invest
200000	202000	in the
202000	204000	research of new technology
204000	206000	we may
206000	208000	discover the new way
208000	210000	who
210000	212000	do not need to be on the
212000	214000	computer or
214000	216000	iPad or something like this
216000	218000	but who can
218000	220000	help the teacher
220000	222000	This is a good
222000	224000	point
224000	226000	if you want a new technology
226000	228000	in class this should be
228000	230000	with great equipment
230000	232000	not necessarily
232000	234000	a computer
234000	236000	but
236000	238000	there will be
238000	240000	some investment
240000	242000	that we need to do
242000	244000	and of course
244000	246000	there will be
246000	248000	an instruction of the teacher
248000	250000	because
250000	252000	not a teacher
252000	254000	knows how to use
254000	256000	keyboard or
256000	258000	computer
258000	260000	for their
260000	262000	course, for
262000	264000	mathematic, for example
264000	266000	there is
266000	268000	inequality between
268000	270000	school that has
270000	272000	the money for this
272000	274000	and school that
274000	276000	doesn't have. I know that and
276000	278000	the government
278000	280000	who has to help
280000	282000	this school
282000	284000	and this teacher
284000	286000	and also the parents
286000	288000	because maybe
288000	290000	the child is
290000	292000	in a
292000	294000	great school
294000	296000	but he may
296000	298000	have no money
298000	300000	but it's a government
300000	302000	who has to help
302000	304000	the school
304000	306000	offer them the
306000	308000	opportunity to
308000	310000	buy new stuff
310000	312000	I agree with you
312000	314000	so if the government
314000	316000	say that
316000	318000	you will invest in this
318000	320000	and of course
320000	322000	give money
322000	324000	to school that
324000	326000	doesn't have that much money
326000	328000	I can
328000	330000	eventually think
330000	332000	that some technology
332000	334000	has a certain level
334000	336000	with a
336000	338000	minimum amount of time
338000	340000	can be good
340000	342000	because
342000	344000	of course
344000	346000	this is not
346000	348000	all about
348000	350000	okay
350000	352000	but maybe we should
352000	354000	just talk about this
354000	356000	with the
356000	358000	governments
358000	360000	for communication
360000	362000	we try to
362000	364000	see what we can do
364000	366000	but I think that
366000	368000	even if we don't
368000	370000	know what the government
370000	372000	was going to say
372000	374000	we know that we have to
374000	376000	invest on your technology
376000	378000	because it's
378000	380000	too
380000	382000	important.
382000	384000	Yes, but
384000	386000	we have to invest
386000	388000	and to invest
388000	390000	in the future
390000	392000	that some people
392000	394000	like government
394000	396000	or
396000	398000	other kind of people
398000	400000	will help
400000	402000	and will do everything
402000	404000	they can
404000	406000	so there isn't any
406000	408000	inequality between
408000	410000	school and between students
410000	412000	because this is the future
412000	414000	sorry
414000	416000	this is the future
416000	418000	this was the
418000	420000	increase in equality
420000	422000	the government
422000	424000	will
424000	426000	choose to
426000	428000	invest.
428000	430000	it's an evidence
430000	432000	because there is too many
432000	434000	so many
434000	438000	how to say
438000	440000	that he
440000	444000	knows he has to do it
444000	455360	school need this for work, and work in a good way, because we saw that the child and the teacher are more
455360	466360	appears in the school when there is more technology.
466360	479360	Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation, technology can be slowly,
479360	489360	actually integrate in a classroom, but with regulation, not every day, like once a week, for example,
489360	494360	to start, or like one hour a day or something like this.
494360	504360	Yes, I agree with you, because we all know that the screen is bad for everyone, not just children.
504360	512360	And we, it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you say.
512360	522360	So the teacher do this part, they have to adapt with the things that we offer today.
522360	531360	And so we just had to agree with the fact that we invest, and that's it.
531360	533360	So I agree with you.
533360	535360	Okay.
