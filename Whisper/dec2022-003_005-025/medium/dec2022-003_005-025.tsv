0	2000	Your candidate number?
2000	3000	05.
3000	5000	Your candidate number is 005.
5000	9000	005, and I'm role A.
9000	13000	And I'm candidate 025, and I'm role B.
13000	18000	Okay, you can begin.
18000	26000	So I personally think that new technologies aren't any good in class,
26000	33000	and it should be something that is out of the school and not in the school.
33000	43000	Okay, I understand your point of view, but today the technology is quite important
43000	52000	because we need computer to access to websites or things like this,
52000	62000	and teachers need to show things to the class or things like this.
62000	71000	Yes, of course, I hear this, but I think that there are some studies that show that
71000	78000	there are two kinds of situations, I think.
78000	89000	There is when there are everyday new technologies, and it can represent a distraction.
89000	98000	And of course, on the other side, there can be like once a week a class with computer
98000	102000	to learn new technologies to the student.
102000	112000	I agree, but I think that the foundation priorities should be the development of new way
112000	121000	with new technologies to learn and to teach for the kids.
121000	131000	It's a better way to learn because they are more happy to be there.
131000	135000	They enjoy the class.
135000	145000	And for the teachers, it's more simple because they can use a lot of things
145000	152000	and diversify how they work.
152000	160000	Yes, but we know for quite a time now that the amount of time that teens,
160000	166000	so students, pass on a device, like a smartphone, computer,
166000	173000	is a huge amount of time, like six to eight hours a day.
173000	179000	So we do not need to increase this time.
179000	186000	I agree with you, but technology is also a keyboard
186000	195000	or the things that can project an image on the keyboard.
195000	204000	And it's not just a computer, so if we invest in the research of new technology,
204000	208000	we may discover the new way.
208000	215000	We do not need to be on a computer or iPad or something like this,
215000	219000	but we can be a technology and help the teacher.
219000	223000	This is a good point, Moni.
223000	229000	If we want a new technology in class, this should be with great equipment, like you said,
229000	233000	not necessarily a computer per student,
233000	240000	but there will be some investment that we need to do.
240000	246000	And of course, there will be maybe instruction of teachers
246000	256000	because not all teachers know how to use a keyboard or computer for their course,
257000	259000	for mathematics, for example.
259000	266000	And so there is maybe inequality between a school that has the money for this
266000	269000	and a school that doesn't have.
269000	275000	I know that, and actually it doesn't really concern us.
275000	282000	It's the government who has to help this school and this teacher,
282000	290000	and also the parents because maybe the child is in a great school,
290000	294000	but he may have no money.
294000	300000	But it's the government who has to help the school,
300000	310000	and we should offer them the opportunity to buy new stuff.
310000	312000	I agree with you.
312000	317000	So if the government says that you will invest in this
317000	326000	and of course give money to a school that doesn't have that much money,
326000	333000	I can eventually think that some technology on a certain level
334000	340000	with a minimum amount of time can be good
340000	348000	because of course this is not all bad.
348000	357000	Okay, but maybe we should just talk about this with the government
357000	362000	for communication and try to see what we can do.
362000	370000	But I think that even if we don't know what the government was going to say,
370000	380000	we know that we have to invest on new technology because it's too important.
380000	387000	Yes, but we have to invest, but to invest we need to have money
387000	394000	and to make sure that some people like government or other kind of people
394000	397000	will help and will do everything they can
397000	403000	so there isn't any inequality between school and between students
403000	409000	because this is the future of the country.
409000	415000	So if some kids don't have the same education as others,
415000	419000	this will increase inequality.
419000	425000	The government will choose to invest.
426000	440000	It's an evidence because there is too many...
440000	447000	He knows he has to do it because the school needs this for work
447000	453000	and work in a good way because we saw that the child
453000	467000	and the teacher are happiest in the school when there is more technology.
467000	475000	Yes, of course, so maybe if this is on good regulation,
475000	483000	technology can be slowly integrated in the classroom,
483000	489000	but with regulation, like I said, not every day, like once a week for example,
489000	494000	to start or like one hour a day or something like this.
494000	502000	Yes, I agree with you because we all know that the screen is bad for everyone,
502000	512000	and it's useful, but we have to regulate, as you say.
512000	521000	So the teachers do this part, they have to adapt with the things that we offer to them.
521000	530000	So we just have to agree with the fact that we invest and that's it.
530000	533000	Yes, so I agree with you.
