0	12960	93, okay and your role is A, okay thank you and my number is a number of 15 with a reward
12960	29040	B. So start the timer when you're ready to 10 minutes with a ring at the end, okay.
29040	33040	So what do you want to start?
33040	47040	I found the technology is very deep, but team technology of addition to technology and screens devices.
47040	56040	So I don't find it's a really good idea to interrupt technology in school.
56040	70040	So for me I think that technology is a good thing for the education because the kids or the children can
70040	82040	just learn something, make it a little bit more fun with games or something like this.
82040	94040	Okay but you don't know how to play games at home and play problems.
94040	118040	I think that the school can make the...
118040	136040	Yeah I see what you want to say, but I think that the parents need also to take a student and place some boarder to him at home.
136040	142040	So we can make the school more fun for the children.
142040	154040	Yeah I agree with you.
154040	166040	What do you think about the form of education with technology?
166040	188040	I think that the education needs to be with games or on board that the children can interact with.
188040	200040	The students can access to internet or something like this to add games in this project.
200040	212040	Yes, but first you don't have a device to do homework at home. So do you have a solution for that?
212040	228040	Yes, for the school can give to the students a computer or a tablet to do homework at home.
228040	240040	So this means that several students, including the low-income students, can have access to this digital tool.
240040	252040	What about teachers? They don't have training for this new technology?
252040	264040	And the teacher can make permission with the energy coach that can make the teacher more comfortable with the technology.
264040	272040	So now to ask you why there is a problem with the technology at the education?
272040	288040	I think it's a good idea, a good concept, but there is some issue with that, like the cost of the device and the cost of training teachers to that new technology.
288040	306040	I think that's for this problem we can have some money and just put the education technology in the years, like in 10 years.
306040	320040	So we can add just when the school parents, for example, where we just put the digital tools in the school.
320040	342040	I think we can finally compromise to the importance of technology in the classroom.
342040	356040	I think we can also technology in the classroom, but not all the day for all the week.
356040	370040	We need to keep a distance with the technology in the classroom to study the traditional way in the tiny paper.
370040	390040	I think that we can make the educational technology, but yes, we need to install some needs, like for example, one or two hours of the time screen per day.
390040	402040	And so we also need to make some tests in the program and make some tests in the classroom.
402040	410040	I think that's a good compromise for the program.
410040	418040	Thank you.
418040	428040	Can you tell us the time please?
428040	450040	Would you like to say something else? Could you tell us three and a half minutes?
450040	460040	I think some things can be made on a couple of days.
460040	472040	I think that can make a computer like you see them.
472040	484040	I think that's a big test to be on the power and to make the difference between technology and real test.
484040	498040	Yes, but it's from the technology.
498040	504040	Can you prefer an exam on paper or in digital?
504040	516040	I think that's a better digital, if there is some restriction on the computer of my notebook, so the students can cheat at the test.
516040	528040	It's more comfortable for students to make information, digital tests about computer science.
528040	536040	I think the algorithm test will be in paper.
536040	540040	The prototype will be kind of tested.
540040	542040	Yes.
542040	550040	We have something else to do.
550040	554040	I think we have the time to do the confirmation.
554040	556040	Thank you.
