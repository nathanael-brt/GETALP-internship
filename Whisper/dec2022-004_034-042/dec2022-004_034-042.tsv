0	19120	I think technology is the future, but she has a many many problems because the students
19120	29200	are already exposed to this technology out of the school, so that's why I think we should
29200	49360	moderate that use and maybe we can put a
49360	65120	plage of of of hours still for example one hour for today and after we continue the
65120	79280	traditional way exercise like papers and books and I agree with you to
80240	92800	keep using books papers and traditional way of learning but in my opinion technology
92800	105040	provides extensive opportunities for students it's a way for them to develop new skills and their
105040	125120	creativity by using devices like tablets, computers etc and it's a new way of learning for them
125120	143440	it can develop their interest for what we we are studying and like you said they already use
144400	165200	electronic devices so developing learning by technology is really in our area and that's why I think
165200	174960	we should develop that point in the school yes but what do you think about the psychology of our
174960	185200	students if we expose too much our students to technology we know that it's a possibility for them
185200	195920	to develop anxiety and I think that can degrade their their relationships so I think we have
195920	208240	to take this in consideration and maybe don't put them really faster to the technology right now
208800	224160	yes I agree we should limit the use of technology in school like two hours per day maybe
224480	240000	that could be interesting to to experiment that way of learning what do you think about a class of
240000	250080	sensibilization we could make a place of sensibilization for parents and for students to show us
250080	263920	the danger of the technology and maybe debate of the benefits and yes I totally agree with you
265760	278560	I think it could be necessary to learn to parents and students the dangers of internet the
279520	290480	extreme use of electronic devices on health for example on the ice and concentration etc
294560	303920	and there is another thing we are not really agree for the technology using this school
304560	308800	I hope the technology will not
313280	320240	use for the homework because there is disparity social and I think that some students are not
320240	332160	the capacity or the materials way to have a computer that they're on or so I think it's important
332240	344400	to let the technology in into school yes or another solution is to ask parents if they have
344400	353680	electronic devices at home and for the students who don't have electronic devices to do homework
354240	369840	maybe school can provide us them a computer to to do their homeworks for example if they have to
369840	380640	do expose that could be a solution for them to to work at home with technology okay
386400	386880	time
387200	405920	what time do you think we should impose to use technology at school
407120	415520	you said two hours per day I am agree with that solution because I think two hours is not
416320	423600	too much one hour is is not enough okay but two hours you have the time to make many things
425600	438160	and I think it's enough okay and in what in what class do you think we should use it for
438160	449280	example plastic art mathematics English okay I think we can use for mathematics French
449280	462720	lesson just for grammar exercise one is about reduction I prefer paper of course but for just
462800	474400	simple exercise computer technology is great way and mathematics of course physical one is
474400	485680	possible SVT you can okay well you can use the technology for see video and it is more you know
486000	500240	attractive for students okay I agree I think we should put in place two hours per day for
500240	501520	these classes
