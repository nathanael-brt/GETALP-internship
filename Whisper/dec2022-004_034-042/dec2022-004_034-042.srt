1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,120
I think technology is the future, but she has a many many problems because the students

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:29,200
are already exposed to this technology out of the school, so that's why I think we should

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:49,360
moderate that use and maybe we can put a

4
00:00:49,360 --> 00:01:05,120
plage of of of hours still for example one hour for today and after we continue the

5
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:19,280
traditional way exercise like papers and books and I agree with you to

6
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:32,800
keep using books papers and traditional way of learning but in my opinion technology

7
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:45,040
provides extensive opportunities for students it's a way for them to develop new skills and their

8
00:01:45,040 --> 00:02:05,120
creativity by using devices like tablets, computers etc and it's a new way of learning for them

9
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:23,440
it can develop their interest for what we we are studying and like you said they already use

10
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:45,200
electronic devices so developing learning by technology is really in our area and that's why I think

11
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:54,960
we should develop that point in the school yes but what do you think about the psychology of our

12
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:05,200
students if we expose too much our students to technology we know that it's a possibility for them

13
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:15,920
to develop anxiety and I think that can degrade their their relationships so I think we have

14
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:28,240
to take this in consideration and maybe don't put them really faster to the technology right now

15
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:44,160
yes I agree we should limit the use of technology in school like two hours per day maybe

16
00:03:44,480 --> 00:04:00,000
that could be interesting to to experiment that way of learning what do you think about a class of

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,080
sensibilization we could make a place of sensibilization for parents and for students to show us

18
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:23,920
the danger of the technology and maybe debate of the benefits and yes I totally agree with you

19
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:38,560
I think it could be necessary to learn to parents and students the dangers of internet the

20
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:50,480
extreme use of electronic devices on health for example on the ice and concentration etc

21
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:03,920
and there is another thing we are not really agree for the technology using this school

22
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,800
I hope the technology will not

23
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,240
use for the homework because there is disparity social and I think that some students are not

24
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:32,160
the capacity or the materials way to have a computer that they're on or so I think it's important

25
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:44,400
to let the technology in into school yes or another solution is to ask parents if they have

26
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:53,680
electronic devices at home and for the students who don't have electronic devices to do homework

27
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:09,840
maybe school can provide us them a computer to to do their homeworks for example if they have to

28
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:20,640
do expose that could be a solution for them to to work at home with technology okay

29
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:26,880
time

30
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:45,920
what time do you think we should impose to use technology at school

31
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:55,520
you said two hours per day I am agree with that solution because I think two hours is not

32
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:03,600
too much one hour is is not enough okay but two hours you have the time to make many things

33
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:18,160
and I think it's enough okay and in what in what class do you think we should use it for

34
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:29,280
example plastic art mathematics English okay I think we can use for mathematics French

35
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:42,720
lesson just for grammar exercise one is about reduction I prefer paper of course but for just

36
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:54,400
simple exercise computer technology is great way and mathematics of course physical one is

37
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:05,680
possible SVT you can okay well you can use the technology for see video and it is more you know

38
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:20,240
attractive for students okay I agree I think we should put in place two hours per day for

39
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
these classes
