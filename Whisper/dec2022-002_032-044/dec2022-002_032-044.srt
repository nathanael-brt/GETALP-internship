1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Number 32, I have the roll-up.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Number 44, roll-up.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You want to start?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Maybe, why not?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes, so our foundation wants to invest in technology for classroom.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think it's an idea because we are in the 21st century.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But we have some problems with that.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And I want to show you why I'm maybe to model a writer's technology using

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
because I think, firstly, it's a potential problem with connection.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And with this problem, we can have some losing time for teachers.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And I'm afraid that I could not have the best solution for the student.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay, I understand your point of view.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think the problems can be solved with the experts that we can hide

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to come help the teachers in class to avoid time loss.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And we have to make formations for teachers to avoid the time loss with technical problems.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And I think we must do all of that because we have to use technology in operation

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:17,000
because it can reduce inequalities between the students that are more affluent

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and the ones who live in less affluent situations.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So we have to do all that.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes, but I see two major problems.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But I understand that I think we will have a problem of cost because it's very expensive

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to have people to hire, to be here for this information problem.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And you say you want to learn to teacher maybe to solve this problem themselves

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
but it's also very expensive to learn to them.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And I think you spoke about inequality but some low incomes students will have technology in classroom.

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a good idea.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I have no problem but you don't think that when they come back home,

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:57,000
if they don't have a connection or good technology, maybe they will be in a situation of inequality because of that.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a question.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Or we can invest for EBSM, for JAK or other way, I don't know.

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But it's very expensive.

32
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And this is a problem of money.

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes, indeed, the problem of money is a very big problem.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:38,000
To counter that, we have to make plans to replace the material and also make updates.

35
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That can be considered in the budget of the foundation.

36
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So I think that's a problem but we can do with that.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Also, yes, you said that the students that have less money can have internet at home and that can be a issue with their own blocks.

38
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And yes, as you said, we can provide them computers or 4G keys.

39
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Because that's very important.

40
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You talked about 20th century skills that are leaning before.

41
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's important that all the students can have those 20th century skills.

42
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And that's important that all of the students can have access to computers and internet.

43
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, so if you think to program and invest on the long time and we can maybe reduce the cost like that, I'm totally agree with this project.

44
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But I have also another issue that I think is in the equation of this system for different points.

45
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think to the example for university and others that are writing test and maybe as a student who are dyslexic, maybe it could be more difficult for them with technology that are writing.

46
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So I suggest you to moderate and keep paper and pen and paper, methodology, even we can introduce technology and it's not a problem.

47
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Just keep a part of old school.

48
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes, you're totally right.

49
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:48,000
For this problem, yes, as you said, we have to keep the pencil and paper based learning because as you said, state programs are traditional.

50
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And the tests must be with pencil and paper.

51
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So a plus we have to keep this way or leaning because the time that spend young people on screens are already high.

52
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So it must be not too high because it can cause anxiety and the social skills can be compromised.

53
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So yes, we have indeed the world to limit this time on the screen.

54
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I agree with you, but I think we can use technology called learning.

55
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So I think we can go to this big investment for school, but it's clear for you and me and I very happy for that.

56
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's that we have to be careful to maintain old school methodology, but it's very important.

57
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I agree to continue to invest further for our century and for the disease students.

58
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, so I'm glad that our students can provide the technological learning in the future.
