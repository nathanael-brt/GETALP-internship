0	28640	So I think for the news, for the article, we have to show that it's important to keep
28640	38800	the animal testing because we don't have choice to do some tests in medicines in another way.
40000	54720	I agree with you on the fact that we have no other solution to stop animal testing,
54720	68560	but I don't think it's a good idea to speak for animal testing, but most against animal testing,
68560	86160	because if people with our article, I think it's important to show that this technique
86160	91840	hurts animals and can kill them.
91840	103840	So you want to speak in an objective way, or you want to give some arguments in the favour of animal testing?
103840	115120	I think it's not possible to speak about the favour of animal testing.
115120	126800	I think I miss and understand myself, because I think we don't have the choice to have to keep the animal testing.
126800	135360	We don't have the other way, but you think we have to do not do this practice. Why?
135520	148960	Because animals are also conscientious, like you and me, and in reality, I think you don't want to test some drugs,
148960	157520	some things which cause the earth to you and kill you.
157600	169760	Yes, but I think human life is better and more important than an animal life, and that's why we don't
169760	178080	test on a child or on a person who has a life where we're conscientious. Animals don't have
178720	186160	a conscience. They'll feel pain, yes, but they don't have a mind and a conscience and a
186160	194160	sophisticated mind, so we don't have the choice. We have to test the medicine in a tissue and
194160	207200	biological tissue on animals. Yes, but okay, if you want, animals are not conscientious, but it's
207200	215920	a part of our world, of our biodiversity, of our environment, and it's very important to keep
215920	235920	their biodiversity in good way. So I think there are other solutions to test medical tests,
235920	250560	so it's not only the solution. You think about what the other way of testing, like new technologies
250560	257280	or just in other way of testing? New technology and other way, but new technology, we are in the
257280	272080	Soviet society, which are in increase and in developing, and all day we are new technology
272080	281360	and new things to increase the world, so we can find a solution to stop animal testing.
281360	294400	Yes, but today at the moment, when we talk, a many of work show that other way of testing are
294400	304400	not benefits and not very scientist. We have just a normal way of testing is animal, maybe in the
304400	314800	future, if we have the money, if we have the knowledge, we can't create just things of simulation
314800	324880	of the human body, but today it's so complicated, I don't know how to create a machine like that,
325600	334000	so I don't have the solution and so for me we have to keep the animal testing because I don't
334000	341760	know the way of construction, we have to build this kind of technology.
344800	354960	I'm a higher boy because the technology is not with the technology is not possible
355040	364960	today to stop animal testing, but in our article, I think it's important to say that
366960	376000	we have, they have a lot of research on technology to stop animal testing and we don't agree,
376960	389840	we disagree, we disagree with the fact of animal testing, but today we don't do with another solution.
390720	399680	And so do you think that we can replace entirely animals because for me,
400560	410240	we are, even if we have some technologies like simulation, like computer, in the future,
410240	419120	we have to keep animals because it's the most, the most closer of human if we don't want to test on
419120	429120	human. Maybe you can reduce this number of animals, but not completely stop this kind of project.
429760	443520	In my mind, in the future, with the evolution of technology, it will completely
443520	454320	be possible, it will be completely possible to stop animal testing, not just reduce, but stop.
454320	465760	Because we have, today we invent a lot of things and I think if we take a little of a whole time
465760	476800	to think about this problem, I think we can find a solution for stop radically animal testing.
478560	487360	Yes, but I disagree with that because that's supposed the fact that we have to create some biological
487360	494720	tissues like human tissue and that's supposed the fact we have to create new humans with
495360	503680	machines like Archifersially. So I think it's unichicol. For me, we have to keep
503680	510480	animal testing because yes, it's not it's unichicol, but the other way is also unichicol. So
511440	521920	it's just we have to reduce at the maximum the risk of suffering that it's very complicated situation.
523280	538880	Okay, so for this article, I think with all of we say that this article should be objective,
539040	550480	talk about animal testing, the argument in favor of animal testing and against animal testing,
550480	560000	I think it's a good way and I think it's very important to talk about the new technology,
560000	568640	the new method to stop animal testing. Yeah, I think we have to, I agree with you for the start,
568640	576640	I think we have to to show the two ways of thinking and make some tailoring for the future.
577520	579840	So thank you.
