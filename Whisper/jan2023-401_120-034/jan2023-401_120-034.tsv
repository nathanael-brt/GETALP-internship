0	21720	When you're ready, okay, so we should write some article about animal testing.
21720	22720	Yes.
22720	25560	What do you think about it?
25560	35560	I think I have a clear, clear, clear, clear pause issue about animal testing.
35560	44520	I just think this is an archaic method, completely outdated, and we have to just think about
44520	53800	how we can do this experience without animal testing.
53800	68800	Because that's just wasting money for nothing, because any solution could replace this animal
68800	69800	testing experience.
69800	73320	Okay, so we have a problem because I disagree.
73320	82720	I think we should write this article in favor of animal testing, because this method
82720	92720	allows breakthrough in science and research for scientific and to understanding the human
92720	95480	body and human disease and everything.
95480	108520	So for me, animal testing is the right method to allow the humanity to have a better life
108520	110720	with understanding this function.
110720	111720	Okay.
111720	115120	Okay, I correct you just in one point.
115120	118640	Maybe in the past, it was a very great solution.
118640	131160	It was completely great to understand, as you say, the functioning of our belief, understand
131160	151160	our physical constructions, but today, we have to think ethically and we humanize our science.
151160	159160	But we can do that, we humanize our science, and you think animals like in a better way
159160	160160	than before.
160160	161160	It's great to me.
161160	172480	But before we don't want to be anything to kill any day, for example, we can use animals
172480	181480	and testing animals for some subject, but not for other, like, for example, cosmetic testing
181480	182480	animals.
182480	183480	It's a shame.
183480	184480	Okay.
184480	185480	An nonsense.
185480	186480	Okay.
186480	197480	No, because we have alternatives, but like, for example, human disease, sometimes we
197480	200480	don't have the correct alternative, like, for example.
200480	201480	It's false.
201480	202480	It's the same virus.
202480	211780	No, as I'm saying, in the case of Alzheimer's, in the mask, we have, we can cure mice who
211780	221040	have Alzheimer's, but we cannot translate it for now, at the human, because we didn't understand
221040	230400	the molecular basis, but to take an alternative, we can use, for example, a computer alternative.
230400	231400	Yes.
231400	235080	But to use it, we have to understand the molecular basis.
235080	239800	So if we don't have the molecular analysis, we cannot use alternative, before you have
239800	246320	to find the alternative by animal testing, what do you think?
246320	255160	What do you think about to create a process of experimentation in vitro, by example,
255160	266200	for, in the same time, in the second time, we can effectively create a program in computer
266200	274440	modellization, which are very, very, very performance, more, maybe, more, in the, in the
274440	286560	other, lot of time, maybe, more performance, that's animal testing, where, computer modellization
286560	293800	are more efficient in a lot of time, but it's not a question, so, we could, we could
293800	301520	say that, okay, it was the past, we did animal testing, and we know the functioning of
301520	310080	our body, and the body, and the cellular, that, that create disease, et cetera, okay.
310080	321920	But now, it's time to, transit to a way of science, which are more human, and when, we
321920	325120	didn't talk about money, what money?
325680	333680	We are the subventions, because we are, legally, we have, legally, the obligation to do animal
333680	340160	testing, it's right in a lot of creative ways. Yes, but a lot of, there, there is more
340160	351360	suppression, as you say, to have, when we are, when we are in the program, in the RS program,
352320	358960	in the RS program, or RS program, you know, or with the, we are just seeing the trigger. So,
360080	369440	if we are, coming in, or RS program, trigger, we have more subventions, and that could be
370800	379360	transition step, between, between the, the experience with animals, and without animals. But,
380080	390880	I just want to, to say, one, one, one, one thing, one fact, 26 billions of dollars, that have been
390880	404640	invests in, experience animal testing, and just 95 persons did not succeed, we didn't translate
404720	413280	the medicant for human, that we test on animals. Yes, it's really good. We could put all this money
413280	422000	on computing, computer modelization, which, increase, which will be, which will increase more and
422000	429920	more, the performance of, computing, computer modelization. Yes, but like I said, it's not about
430000	441360	efficient, and increase the development, it's about reality, and reality, and point of the world.
441360	447680	It's like, if you don't understand the buzzes, yes, you can, we know the buzzes. No, we don't know
447680	452080	the buzzes, we know the buzzes. So, how, what is the basis of other animals?
452080	460880	Oh, sorry, I'm not in scientific lessons, or grades, or so we don't have the buzzes. So, we have
460880	467760	to find it, maybe, maybe you're right, and maybe we can take the point of view of the
468560	475280	middle, like the triage. I'm okay with the triage, but with the triage, maybe, maybe, maybe
475360	482560	acceleration, acceleration of the triage. We cannot accelerate it. When the triage has been
482560	492240	created, 15th, in the 15th. Yes, but it's a plan of long time. Are you okay to say that it's
492240	502720	outdated? We have to create a new model with acceleration, but we can't skip the animal testing,
503200	508000	in the future, in the future. No, in the future, we can't, but no, we can't. How many years?
509200	516720	25 years? 25 years? No, we have to create the acceleration of triage, that could be
517760	528400	the speed triage. Okay, so, alternative. We write our article about the triage, and you do your
528400	535360	research about the speed triage after the article. No, didn't? No, we could just complete,
536160	542320	create a compromise with your review. I have to get a compromise, your review. No, no, no, no,
542320	548400	you want to skip the animal testing in the 25 years. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I want to write
548400	557920	our article. Our article. Our article. Create a barrier between us, you man, that we are just
559040	568400	exploiting the rest of nature. It's just outdated. It was in the 19th, in the 20th century. Okay,
568400	576080	it was great, and we understand the function of genesis, etc. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We have
576080	582000	to write an article and choose an article. Okay, so, so, you can write, it's outdated.
582000	590080	I can write. No, no, no, listen to me. You write, it's outdated. I write, we still do it,
590080	598240	and we write the triage metals. Yes, we've read it. Okay, could we just
598240	603360	notify that we could accelerate the triage metals at the conclusion, at the conclusion,
603360	605040	at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the
605040	613200	last, the last song of the fence. Oh, you, you are, you are, you are, you are, but we are okay to say
613200	618640	that 25 years to skip the animal testing is two. Three ago. Okay.
