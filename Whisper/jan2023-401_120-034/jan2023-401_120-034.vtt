00:00.000 --> 00:21.720
When you're ready, okay, so we should write some article about animal testing.

00:21.720 --> 00:22.720
Yes.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.560
What do you think about it?

00:25.560 --> 00:35.560
I think I have a clear, clear, clear, clear pause issue about animal testing.

00:35.560 --> 00:44.520
I just think this is an archaic method, completely outdated, and we have to just think about

00:44.520 --> 00:53.800
how we can do this experience without animal testing.

00:53.800 --> 01:08.800
Because that's just wasting money for nothing, because any solution could replace this animal

01:08.800 --> 01:09.800
testing experience.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.320
Okay, so we have a problem because I disagree.

01:13.320 --> 01:22.720
I think we should write this article in favor of animal testing, because this method

01:22.720 --> 01:32.720
allows breakthrough in science and research for scientific and to understanding the human

01:32.720 --> 01:35.480
body and human disease and everything.

01:35.480 --> 01:48.520
So for me, animal testing is the right method to allow the humanity to have a better life

01:48.520 --> 01:50.720
with understanding this function.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
Okay.

01:51.720 --> 01:55.120
Okay, I correct you just in one point.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.640
Maybe in the past, it was a very great solution.

01:58.640 --> 02:11.160
It was completely great to understand, as you say, the functioning of our belief, understand

02:11.160 --> 02:31.160
our physical constructions, but today, we have to think ethically and we humanize our science.

02:31.160 --> 02:39.160
But we can do that, we humanize our science, and you think animals like in a better way

02:39.160 --> 02:40.160
than before.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.160
It's great to me.

02:41.160 --> 02:52.480
But before we don't want to be anything to kill any day, for example, we can use animals

02:52.480 --> 03:01.480
and testing animals for some subject, but not for other, like, for example, cosmetic testing

03:01.480 --> 03:02.480
animals.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.480
It's a shame.

03:03.480 --> 03:04.480
Okay.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.480
An nonsense.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.480
Okay.

03:06.480 --> 03:17.480
No, because we have alternatives, but like, for example, human disease, sometimes we

03:17.480 --> 03:20.480
don't have the correct alternative, like, for example.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.480
It's false.

03:21.480 --> 03:22.480
It's the same virus.

03:22.480 --> 03:31.780
No, as I'm saying, in the case of Alzheimer's, in the mask, we have, we can cure mice who

03:31.780 --> 03:41.040
have Alzheimer's, but we cannot translate it for now, at the human, because we didn't understand

03:41.040 --> 03:50.400
the molecular basis, but to take an alternative, we can use, for example, a computer alternative.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.400
Yes.

03:51.400 --> 03:55.080
But to use it, we have to understand the molecular basis.

03:55.080 --> 03:59.800
So if we don't have the molecular analysis, we cannot use alternative, before you have

03:59.800 --> 04:06.320
to find the alternative by animal testing, what do you think?

04:06.320 --> 04:15.160
What do you think about to create a process of experimentation in vitro, by example,

04:15.160 --> 04:26.200
for, in the same time, in the second time, we can effectively create a program in computer

04:26.200 --> 04:34.440
modellization, which are very, very, very performance, more, maybe, more, in the, in the

04:34.440 --> 04:46.560
other, lot of time, maybe, more performance, that's animal testing, where, computer modellization

04:46.560 --> 04:53.800
are more efficient in a lot of time, but it's not a question, so, we could, we could

04:53.800 --> 05:01.520
say that, okay, it was the past, we did animal testing, and we know the functioning of

05:01.520 --> 05:10.080
our body, and the body, and the cellular, that, that create disease, et cetera, okay.

05:10.080 --> 05:21.920
But now, it's time to, transit to a way of science, which are more human, and when, we

05:21.920 --> 05:25.120
didn't talk about money, what money?

05:25.680 --> 05:33.680
We are the subventions, because we are, legally, we have, legally, the obligation to do animal

05:33.680 --> 05:40.160
testing, it's right in a lot of creative ways. Yes, but a lot of, there, there is more

05:40.160 --> 05:51.360
suppression, as you say, to have, when we are, when we are in the program, in the RS program,

05:52.320 --> 05:58.960
in the RS program, or RS program, you know, or with the, we are just seeing the trigger. So,

06:00.080 --> 06:09.440
if we are, coming in, or RS program, trigger, we have more subventions, and that could be

06:10.800 --> 06:19.360
transition step, between, between the, the experience with animals, and without animals. But,

06:20.080 --> 06:30.880
I just want to, to say, one, one, one, one thing, one fact, 26 billions of dollars, that have been

06:30.880 --> 06:44.640
invests in, experience animal testing, and just 95 persons did not succeed, we didn't translate

06:44.720 --> 06:53.280
the medicant for human, that we test on animals. Yes, it's really good. We could put all this money

06:53.280 --> 07:02.000
on computing, computer modelization, which, increase, which will be, which will increase more and

07:02.000 --> 07:09.920
more, the performance of, computing, computer modelization. Yes, but like I said, it's not about

07:10.000 --> 07:21.360
efficient, and increase the development, it's about reality, and reality, and point of the world.

07:21.360 --> 07:27.680
It's like, if you don't understand the buzzes, yes, you can, we know the buzzes. No, we don't know

07:27.680 --> 07:32.080
the buzzes, we know the buzzes. So, how, what is the basis of other animals?

07:32.080 --> 07:40.880
Oh, sorry, I'm not in scientific lessons, or grades, or so we don't have the buzzes. So, we have

07:40.880 --> 07:47.760
to find it, maybe, maybe you're right, and maybe we can take the point of view of the

07:48.560 --> 07:55.280
middle, like the triage. I'm okay with the triage, but with the triage, maybe, maybe, maybe

07:55.360 --> 08:02.560
acceleration, acceleration of the triage. We cannot accelerate it. When the triage has been

08:02.560 --> 08:12.240
created, 15th, in the 15th. Yes, but it's a plan of long time. Are you okay to say that it's

08:12.240 --> 08:22.720
outdated? We have to create a new model with acceleration, but we can't skip the animal testing,

08:23.200 --> 08:28.000
in the future, in the future. No, in the future, we can't, but no, we can't. How many years?

08:29.200 --> 08:36.720
25 years? 25 years? No, we have to create the acceleration of triage, that could be

08:37.760 --> 08:48.400
the speed triage. Okay, so, alternative. We write our article about the triage, and you do your

08:48.400 --> 08:55.360
research about the speed triage after the article. No, didn't? No, we could just complete,

08:56.160 --> 09:02.320
create a compromise with your review. I have to get a compromise, your review. No, no, no, no,

09:02.320 --> 09:08.400
you want to skip the animal testing in the 25 years. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I want to write

09:08.400 --> 09:17.920
our article. Our article. Our article. Create a barrier between us, you man, that we are just

09:19.040 --> 09:28.400
exploiting the rest of nature. It's just outdated. It was in the 19th, in the 20th century. Okay,

09:28.400 --> 09:36.080
it was great, and we understand the function of genesis, etc. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We have

09:36.080 --> 09:42.000
to write an article and choose an article. Okay, so, so, you can write, it's outdated.

09:42.000 --> 09:50.080
I can write. No, no, no, listen to me. You write, it's outdated. I write, we still do it,

09:50.080 --> 09:58.240
and we write the triage metals. Yes, we've read it. Okay, could we just

09:58.240 --> 10:03.360
notify that we could accelerate the triage metals at the conclusion, at the conclusion,

10:03.360 --> 10:05.040
at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the conclusion, at the

10:05.040 --> 10:13.200
last, the last song of the fence. Oh, you, you are, you are, you are, you are, but we are okay to say

10:13.200 --> 10:18.640
that 25 years to skip the animal testing is two. Three ago. Okay.
