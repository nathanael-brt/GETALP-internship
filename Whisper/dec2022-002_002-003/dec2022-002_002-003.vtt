00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
So I'm candidat002 and I'm the role A.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
And I'm the candidat003 and the role B.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Well, hello, when you say, I don't know your name, I'm sorry.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
I'm John. I'm you.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm Carol.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Okay, nice to meet you.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
We are talking today about the tactile duty on the classroom.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Yeah.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
What do you think about?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Well, I'm pro-technology, I could say.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
I believe we should implement technology more in the classroom,

00:39.000 --> 00:47.000
but of course implement your regulations to make sure that the students learn from technology,

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
but not with it, and to make sure that their school experience is the best.

00:51.000 --> 00:58.000
Okay, I have absolutely any problem with the fact that students can learn with technologies.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
But there's I think some aspects which are dangerous, such as bullying.

01:04.000 --> 01:16.000
And for that, I think that we need to put in place a kind of system of control of the informatic tools.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
And it has to be encoderated by the teachers,

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
when students are using it. What do you think about?

01:25.000 --> 01:31.000
Well, the bullying is one of the risks that is really evident with social media,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
and the fact that students are using it more and more,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
and that their parents are having problems regulating it,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
because they don't really understand their principle.

01:40.000 --> 01:48.000
So that is why we could also try and implement strict rules regarding their devices.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
Like an example was given of the fact that some teachers at the beginning of their classes

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
used to ask questions and students,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
and it would be easier for students to answer the forums online,

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
and to make sure that those forums are only parts of the school website, for example,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
and that are used by everyone,

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
and of course strict regulation regarding maybe course words,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
and make sure that they are filters, etc.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
Yeah, and I think that they should also verify the history of the,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
for example, the computers or all the devices,

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
which were used by the students.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
It has to be moderated.

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
They don't have, I think, that they don't have to stay all day behind a screen,

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
and it has to be only used in an educated way, for example,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
for homework, for researchers, something like that,

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
and absolutely in any case, for personal uses.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
It's a very interesting idea, but it's dangerous if it's not well done.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Yeah, I remember teacher, sixth grade teacher,

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
if I remember, of the Fisher Middle School localizing you from the UK

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
that said in her classes,

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
she used around one hour of her time for the students to go online,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
to use the screens, etc.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
And I was a little bit surprised and unfounded,

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
unfounded to find that, because I think it's a little bit too much.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
So we should implement rules regarding the hours,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
make sure they don't spend too much time,

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
and that the screens they are on doesn't replace the students.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
Yeah, but we can also make a kind of open space,

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
or co-working space in this school,

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
and where there will be some technological devices,

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
which can be used every time of the day,

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
and could pay me to the students to work as they want,

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
with some teachers around who could look at what they are doing,

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
if it's in a link or not with the school,

04:20.000 --> 04:27.000
and maybe put in place a system of card that they had to insert

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
in a kind of box,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
which will vary five if they have already used in the day,

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
a computer, and making some, as you say, filters,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
and reducing the time of use per day,

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
for example, to maximum one hour.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, that's a really interesting idea, John.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
It's still a good idea, because it's still a combination

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
of normal, traditional ways of learning,

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
and also screens.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Like some said, a teacher said that she used Kagan structures,

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
which is a form of cooperative learning moment,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
and also because they had little book clubs,

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
so they would use computers and tablets to learn a little bit more,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
but they also had things outside of screens

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
by interacting with others and learning at the same time.

05:27.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah, and also there's not only computers or screens,

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
there's also the book club in which Kagan continued to learn

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
and to check all the information that they need for their works,

05:44.000 --> 05:56.000
and also I was thinking about a sensibilization of the students,

05:56.000 --> 06:05.000
but also the teachers of the schools about the impact psychologically,

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
and also physically, for example, the eye and the health.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
And I think that this system of co-working space

06:18.000 --> 06:27.000
with some informatic devices will permit to avoid the social

06:27.000 --> 06:35.000
and economical fracture that there is between them,

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
as it was said, in an article between the white colors

06:40.000 --> 06:50.000
and the black colors due to their origins and their lifestyle,

06:50.000 --> 06:57.000
because many people who are of black skin color

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
don't have informatic devices for work.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Well, yeah, currently technology is a bit of a working problem in progress.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
Like we said, the technology has a real tool on mental health,

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
with anxiety, low self esteem, sometimes depression,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
and yeah, some are more advantage,

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
because their parents, for example, have high incomes,

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
compared to others that don't really have access to computers

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
because their parents get afford to.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
So, like I said before, try and regulate and also help

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
by funding schools so that each student can be able to access computers in school.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
And I think we should do that also,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
because we have a lot of learning to do,

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
but also learning techniques are present with technology.

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
Like this topic of constructivism,

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
an inquiry-based learning, for example,

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
where students are taught to search for topics in themselves,

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
and teachers are there to guide them.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
And you can help with independence,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
constructing a train of thoughts,

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
answering questions and understanding instructions.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
Yeah, so I absolutely agree with all that you said.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
I think that the thing that we have to put in place

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
is to moderate and control the behavior of the students

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
and moderate in function of the age of the students.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
For example, the first great student

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
have to use in the maximum half hour per day the computers

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
and the last year students, for example,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
maximum two hours to prepare their exams.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
I don't know what you think about.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Well, I think we can both agree that the main,

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
the foundation, the main priority,

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
is to ensure that technology is available to everyone,

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
but also that there are strict rules to make sure

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
that it doesn't end badly for the students themselves.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Yeah, so you agree with that?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Yeah.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Perfect, thank you.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Thank you.
