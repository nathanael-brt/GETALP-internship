1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So I'm candidat002 and I'm the role A.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm the candidat003 and the role B.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, hello, when you say, I don't know your name, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm John. I'm you.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm Carol.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay, nice to meet you.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We are talking today about the tactile duty on the classroom.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What do you think about?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, I'm pro-technology, I could say.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I believe we should implement technology more in the classroom,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
but of course implement your regulations to make sure that the students learn from technology,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but not with it, and to make sure that their school experience is the best.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, I have absolutely any problem with the fact that students can learn with technologies.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But there's I think some aspects which are dangerous, such as bullying.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And for that, I think that we need to put in place a kind of system of control of the informatic tools.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And it has to be encoderated by the teachers,

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
when students are using it. What do you think about?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, the bullying is one of the risks that is really evident with social media,

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and the fact that students are using it more and more,

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and that their parents are having problems regulating it,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
because they don't really understand their principle.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So that is why we could also try and implement strict rules regarding their devices.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Like an example was given of the fact that some teachers at the beginning of their classes

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
used to ask questions and students,

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and it would be easier for students to answer the forums online,

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and to make sure that those forums are only parts of the school website, for example,

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and that are used by everyone,

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and of course strict regulation regarding maybe course words,

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
and make sure that they are filters, etc.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, and I think that they should also verify the history of the,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
for example, the computers or all the devices,

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
which were used by the students.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It has to be moderated.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They don't have, I think, that they don't have to stay all day behind a screen,

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and it has to be only used in an educated way, for example,

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
for homework, for researchers, something like that,

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and absolutely in any case, for personal uses.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's a very interesting idea, but it's dangerous if it's not well done.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah, I remember teacher, sixth grade teacher,

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
if I remember, of the Fisher Middle School localizing you from the UK

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
that said in her classes,

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
she used around one hour of her time for the students to go online,

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
to use the screens, etc.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And I was a little bit surprised and unfounded,

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
unfounded to find that, because I think it's a little bit too much.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So we should implement rules regarding the hours,

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
make sure they don't spend too much time,

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and that the screens they are on doesn't replace the students.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, but we can also make a kind of open space,

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
or co-working space in this school,

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and where there will be some technological devices,

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
which can be used every time of the day,

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and could pay me to the students to work as they want,

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
with some teachers around who could look at what they are doing,

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
if it's in a link or not with the school,

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and maybe put in place a system of card that they had to insert

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
in a kind of box,

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
which will vary five if they have already used in the day,

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
a computer, and making some, as you say, filters,

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and reducing the time of use per day,

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
for example, to maximum one hour.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, that's a really interesting idea, John.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's still a good idea, because it's still a combination

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
of normal, traditional ways of learning,

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and also screens.

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Like some said, a teacher said that she used Kagan structures,

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
which is a form of cooperative learning moment,

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and also because they had little book clubs,

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
so they would use computers and tablets to learn a little bit more,

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
but they also had things outside of screens

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
by interacting with others and learning at the same time.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, and also there's not only computers or screens,

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
there's also the book club in which Kagan continued to learn

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and to check all the information that they need for their works,

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and also I was thinking about a sensibilization of the students,

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
but also the teachers of the schools about the impact psychologically,

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and also physically, for example, the eye and the health.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And I think that this system of co-working space

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
with some informatic devices will permit to avoid the social

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and economical fracture that there is between them,

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
as it was said, in an article between the white colors

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:50,000
and the black colors due to their origins and their lifestyle,

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
because many people who are of black skin color

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
don't have informatic devices for work.

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, yeah, currently technology is a bit of a working problem in progress.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Like we said, the technology has a real tool on mental health,

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
with anxiety, low self esteem, sometimes depression,

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and yeah, some are more advantage,

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
because their parents, for example, have high incomes,

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
compared to others that don't really have access to computers

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
because their parents get afford to.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So, like I said before, try and regulate and also help

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
by funding schools so that each student can be able to access computers in school.

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And I think we should do that also,

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
because we have a lot of learning to do,

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but also learning techniques are present with technology.

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Like this topic of constructivism,

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
an inquiry-based learning, for example,

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
where students are taught to search for topics in themselves,

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and teachers are there to guide them.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And you can help with independence,

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
constructing a train of thoughts,

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
answering questions and understanding instructions.

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, so I absolutely agree with all that you said.

106
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think that the thing that we have to put in place

107
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
is to moderate and control the behavior of the students

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and moderate in function of the age of the students.

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
For example, the first great student

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
have to use in the maximum half hour per day the computers

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and the last year students, for example,

112
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
maximum two hours to prepare their exams.

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't know what you think about.

114
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, I think we can both agree that the main,

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the foundation, the main priority,

116
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
is to ensure that technology is available to everyone,

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
but also that there are strict rules to make sure

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
that it doesn't end badly for the students themselves.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah, so you agree with that?

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah.

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Perfect, thank you.

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Thank you.
