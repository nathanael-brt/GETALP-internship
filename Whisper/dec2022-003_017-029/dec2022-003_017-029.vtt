00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Yes, zero, one, seven.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
Can you roll?

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
A roll, eight.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
And yours please?

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Zero, two, nine, and a whole bit.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Okay, when you're ready, you guys can begin.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
You have eight minutes to ten minutes.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
And this means you have one minute left.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Okay.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
You can begin now.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
You start.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Two.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
How's your heart?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Okay.

00:27.000 --> 00:34.000
I'm going to defend the fact that the school should remodelate the use of the technology

00:34.000 --> 00:42.000
in the classroom, because there's a lot of negative points about it.

00:42.000 --> 00:51.000
Like, it's not a good thing to be in-screen all day for a child, because it can develop

00:51.000 --> 01:00.000
and anxiety and the child can become and go more usually.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
And they're not very concentrated when they're on a screen.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.400
No one can really watch what they're doing in front of the screen, so it can develop

01:11.400 --> 01:18.400
a possible arsement, so it's why it should be in-moderate.

01:18.400 --> 01:27.400
I personally think that have technology in classes, it's a new perspective of teaching,

01:27.400 --> 01:36.400
and it enables students to be curious and search information online on topics they like.

01:36.400 --> 01:44.400
And also, ecologically speaking, it's good for environment, because we don't have to use paper.

01:44.400 --> 01:51.400
So I think it's quite good.

01:51.400 --> 02:02.400
Well, what about the motivation of the use, because of the cyber arsement that can be made of?

02:02.400 --> 02:05.400
I'm listening to your point.

02:05.400 --> 02:15.400
I think it has this topic of technology in classes as pros and cons,

02:15.400 --> 02:20.400
and your telling and cons that is arsement.

02:20.400 --> 02:32.400
But I think that things could be put to avoid arsement.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.400
I don't have solutions.

02:37.400 --> 02:47.400
But don't you think that people must not be very concentrated when they're not in front of the screen?

02:47.400 --> 02:52.400
You know what I mean? When the teacher is speaking in a traditional way,

02:52.400 --> 03:00.400
that you will think, okay, let's not be concentrated now and be concentrated on the screen because it's fun.

03:00.400 --> 03:13.400
I have mixed feelings about that, because I think that technology can allow children or students and teachers

03:13.400 --> 03:20.400
to have a dialogue, another dialogue from the classics school.

03:20.400 --> 03:31.400
I think also that now with the development of data, it's more practical.

03:31.400 --> 03:41.400
To search online things than in books.

03:41.400 --> 03:51.400
And how about the...

03:51.400 --> 03:53.400
Oh, I don't know.

03:53.400 --> 04:06.400
What about the anxiety, the anger, and all the negative points that the studies show of the screen?

04:06.400 --> 04:16.400
Don't you think that a low children at home is usually on the screen, come to class?

04:16.400 --> 04:20.400
Also, a screen is a good thing for the development of the side.

04:20.400 --> 04:27.400
I don't know, but it's a road to do a certain...

04:27.400 --> 04:30.400
How do you say?

04:31.400 --> 04:35.400
You can follow the line.

04:35.400 --> 04:47.400
I think it's great to have technology in school and at home because for children,

04:47.400 --> 04:57.400
it's more practical and for teachers.

04:57.400 --> 05:03.400
It's a new perspective to teach and it's interesting for them.

05:03.400 --> 05:12.400
But what about the people who are not very...

05:12.400 --> 05:22.400
Well, we don't really use the teacher, we don't really use the screen or everything.

05:22.400 --> 05:29.400
And when you ask them to teach with the things that they didn't know how to use it.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.400
Yes.

05:30.400 --> 05:48.400
The fact is that teachers in their childhood, in the last decade, weren't happy to use technology because it didn't exist.

05:48.400 --> 05:59.400
But the thing is that they can now be coached and they can learn to...

05:59.400 --> 06:00.400
Learn to...

06:00.400 --> 06:05.400
No, I don't know how to proceed.

06:11.400 --> 06:16.400
So we can find a compromise, a compromise, yes.

06:17.400 --> 06:27.400
I listen to what you are saying and I think that the screen is a good thing but it should be moderated.

06:27.400 --> 06:39.400
It's not a no for me to be used at school but it should be moderated because of everything that is the consequence of the using of the screen.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.400
Yes.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.400
I totally agree with you.

06:41.400 --> 06:48.400
And I think one or two hours per day or per week, it's a good thing.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.400
Yeah.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.400
And not no more.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.400
Yes.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.400
It should be a...

06:53.400 --> 06:57.400
The traditional way should be used.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.400
Yes.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.400
And not only on the screen.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.400
Yeah.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.400
Both are perfect.
