00:05.680 --> 00:06.880
Hello, colleague

00:06.880 --> 00:08.080
Good morning

00:08.080 --> 00:10.080
Ah, this is

00:10.960 --> 00:14.800
We were asked to make suggestion to the supervisor

00:16.160 --> 00:18.160
about the foundation prior it is

00:19.200 --> 00:22.880
I'm actually really in favor to develop technologies

00:22.880 --> 00:24.480
I'm not really

00:25.200 --> 00:28.480
Well for me is like it's a tool

00:29.040 --> 00:32.640
It's used in everyday life as a professional

00:32.640 --> 00:36.400
or professionals use technologies every day

00:37.040 --> 00:40.880
So we need to teach the students how to use it

00:40.880 --> 00:43.920
in order for them to succeed in their professional life

00:43.920 --> 00:45.520
Yeah, I agree with you but

00:46.800 --> 00:49.760
You know some students are poor

00:49.760 --> 00:50.560
Yeah

00:50.560 --> 00:53.840
And some professionals are rich because they have a job

00:53.840 --> 00:55.360
and they have a life, they have a family

00:56.080 --> 00:59.600
And sometimes the students

01:01.120 --> 01:04.560
even where they are immigrants

01:04.560 --> 01:05.600
for example

01:05.600 --> 01:09.440
they don't have any money to buy a computer

01:09.440 --> 01:14.400
and it's difficult for those people to use computer at school

01:14.400 --> 01:15.600
Yeah, I agree with you

01:15.600 --> 01:17.840
That's why the school need to provide them

01:17.840 --> 01:20.800
with computer and technology material

01:20.800 --> 01:22.000
It's just school to provide them

01:22.000 --> 01:24.160
such as the school provides books

01:24.160 --> 01:24.960
For example

01:24.960 --> 01:28.720
Yes, but books are less expensive than computers

01:28.720 --> 01:34.160
School can't buy all computers for all students

01:34.160 --> 01:36.640
Well, it is great because it's in investments

01:36.640 --> 01:41.200
Like book needs to be changed every two or three years

01:41.200 --> 01:45.280
and you have to buy like a way like a wide range of books

01:45.280 --> 01:48.640
for every materials and for all the students

01:48.640 --> 01:50.240
whereas when you have the computer

01:50.240 --> 01:54.160
you only buy one computer and you have all the material on one computer

01:54.160 --> 01:58.160
and it's used not for one student but for a lot of them

01:58.160 --> 02:03.200
And if there is some degradation on the computer what you do

02:03.200 --> 02:09.840
if some students break it or don't take care of a computer

02:09.840 --> 02:13.680
what you do you change it and it's more expensive

02:13.680 --> 02:15.760
that change your book

02:15.760 --> 02:18.560
Well, it's more expensive but when students

02:18.560 --> 02:21.520
degrades books they need to repay for it

02:21.520 --> 02:26.560
so if they degrades the computer they will need to repay it

02:26.560 --> 02:32.720
Yes, but repay a computer is too expensive for students

02:32.720 --> 02:36.160
look at some manifestation in the streets

02:36.160 --> 02:40.480
where students are poor

02:40.480 --> 02:44.000
ask for money, ask for money for by food

02:44.000 --> 02:52.480
for by an invitation and it's not possible for a student to buy a computer

02:52.480 --> 02:54.240
as they want

02:54.240 --> 02:58.640
Well, maybe if the computer says that school is safer for the material

02:58.640 --> 03:00.320
like if they don't bring it at home

03:00.320 --> 03:02.880
they only use it inside the school

03:02.880 --> 03:06.080
maybe they are less risk to break it

03:06.080 --> 03:11.760
So you want to make a mix like at school computer

03:11.760 --> 03:14.640
and at home books

03:14.640 --> 03:19.040
Yeah, so for me like using technology is really important

03:19.040 --> 03:22.080
and to develop like creativity and safe learning

03:22.080 --> 03:26.080
because it's more an intuitive way to learn

03:26.080 --> 03:30.160
than just writing books and memorizing information

03:30.160 --> 03:36.720
and so it's more like the learning to make projects to do research

03:36.720 --> 03:40.240
and stuff like that so we give them more trust

03:40.240 --> 03:44.000
and there are more ability for them to learn

03:44.000 --> 03:52.160
Yes, but some studies show that we learn better with a book

03:52.160 --> 03:57.280
while we're reading that while we're typing or we're searching on the internet

03:57.280 --> 04:04.320
So it's more difficult for students to learn by a computer

04:04.320 --> 04:08.000
than if they really read a book

04:08.320 --> 04:10.560
I disagree with you about that

04:10.560 --> 04:12.800
it might be true about writing

04:12.800 --> 04:15.440
whereas typing on the computer

04:15.440 --> 04:18.960
but actually when you search the information yourself

04:18.960 --> 04:21.440
you'll like more interested in the task

04:21.440 --> 04:25.040
so you will retain the information better

04:25.040 --> 04:29.520
Yes, but you can also sell the information in the book

04:29.520 --> 04:32.640
and you can write it by your hand

04:32.640 --> 04:35.840
and it will be better for your memory

04:35.920 --> 04:38.560
by my personal experience

04:38.560 --> 04:43.680
I know that to learn something I had to read it, I had to learn it

04:43.680 --> 04:50.640
and if I only type it on the computer I come to go to exam and succeed

04:50.640 --> 04:54.880
Yeah, school is not only about learning information

04:54.880 --> 04:57.120
in order to put it in the exam

04:57.120 --> 05:01.920
it's also about learning how to search, how to make projects

05:02.000 --> 05:06.400
how to create something and how to research the information

05:06.400 --> 05:11.840
in order to learn more or to develop some competence

05:11.840 --> 05:18.480
So for that I think the technology is the right tools and not books

05:18.480 --> 05:27.040
I agree but look, for example, we are in Africa but in Africa

05:27.040 --> 05:29.840
they can't have a book already

05:29.840 --> 05:37.120
and if we want to reorganize the school system

05:37.120 --> 05:42.160
that means that some people that can't buy a book

05:42.160 --> 05:46.400
have to buy a computer, it's impossible

05:46.400 --> 05:50.800
Yeah, of course we need to put finances into our budget

05:50.800 --> 05:52.720
to finance all these projects

05:52.720 --> 05:53.680
And you think...

05:53.680 --> 05:57.920
And of course education comes first before technology

05:58.000 --> 06:03.040
So in Africa, education even if it starts with book

06:03.040 --> 06:09.280
and then can involve with technology is more important

06:09.280 --> 06:12.480
but if we want them to really succeed

06:12.480 --> 06:14.800
they need to learn how to use all the tools

06:14.800 --> 06:17.600
they're going to use in their professional life

06:17.600 --> 06:24.480
That's why for me we need to increase our technology teaching

06:24.560 --> 06:28.000
but for that the teachers need to be formed as well

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
they cannot just put the child in front of the computer

06:32.000 --> 06:35.840
and let them do their thing, they need to guide them

06:35.840 --> 06:41.120
and that way we are not in the system where the teacher is on the shelf

06:41.120 --> 06:43.600
and like the students are behind him

06:43.600 --> 06:47.600
but it's more cooperative when the teacher only guides them

06:47.600 --> 06:51.920
and the students are all safe learning or self-creating

06:52.000 --> 06:55.440
Yes, but you have to buy computers

06:55.440 --> 07:00.080
you have to teach how to use computers

07:00.080 --> 07:07.920
you have to say at some teacher that are old

07:07.920 --> 07:18.800
that are learning all of those teachers are not able to use computers

07:18.800 --> 07:22.240
because they learn school with books

07:22.240 --> 07:25.120
they are learning school with writing at the hand

07:25.120 --> 07:29.280
so that's mean that we need to teach everything

07:29.280 --> 07:35.760
and I think it's a little bit complicated in one second

07:35.760 --> 07:38.560
so I argue with you with all what you said

07:38.560 --> 07:41.840
but we have to make a transition

07:41.840 --> 07:47.440
not to stop all of book and to pass all of computers

07:47.440 --> 07:49.760
yeah, not what I said

07:49.760 --> 07:56.560
actually we just need to increase the work in the teaching we do with technologies

07:56.560 --> 08:00.320
and the age of the teacher doesn't matter

08:00.320 --> 08:03.760
actually teachers need to be formed

08:03.760 --> 08:08.400
because science is always evolving for example

08:08.400 --> 08:11.280
we're not saying that the earth is flat nowadays

08:11.280 --> 08:16.080
so teachers always have to learn in order to teach

08:16.080 --> 08:25.040
and if the teachers learn about technology the age of the teacher really doesn't matter

08:25.040 --> 08:31.120
so for me it's really important and education is always about teaching and learning

08:31.120 --> 08:34.000
where has your students or a teacher

08:34.000 --> 08:39.280
I agree with you so we can make some agreement

08:39.280 --> 08:42.560
yeah maybe just increase like technology class

08:42.800 --> 08:44.800
a little bit not too much

08:44.800 --> 08:48.160
because it's dangerous for for economic of family

08:48.160 --> 08:50.960
for economic of school it's a

08:50.960 --> 08:56.080
it's an investment yes say the future it will go back

08:56.080 --> 08:57.840
i agree with you it's more benefits

08:57.840 --> 09:00.000
it's transition not too fast

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
okay we can go with the transition

09:02.000 --> 09:02.720
okay perfect
