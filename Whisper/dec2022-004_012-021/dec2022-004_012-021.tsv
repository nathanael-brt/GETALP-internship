0	19560	I'd like to say that the use of technology in the classroom is not always good, it can
19560	24400	bring a lot of harm to students and also to the school as well.
24400	30560	First of all, I'd like to say it's expensive to implement, you need to buy the goods like computers
30560	38240	and boards, and also the equipment that you need to maintain the computers.
38240	50120	Yeah, but I think that is the role of the states, the states need to pay for all of it because
50120	62160	it's his job to provide to all students to have the equipment required for good learning and
62160	63520	good teaching.
63520	69840	Indeed, it could be the role of the state to provide, but you have also to take an account
69840	74400	of the fact that teachers need to be trained, which also costs money and time away from
74400	81400	the students who could benefit of a more traditional way of education, so where would
81400	82840	that money come from?
82840	91000	Yes, but to my mind, the new teachers will bring the new 21st century children, so they
91000	99680	will grow up with the new technology, so we will need to teach them less than actually
99680	102320	with the old teacher.
102320	108600	So don't you think that progressively the teacher won't be needed and it could lead to unemployment?
108600	114720	If their children are able to study without teachers and just using technology, maybe
114720	120760	one day it will go too far and we will lose the profession that is teaching?
120760	126000	No, because I'm not saying that robots can replace teachers.
126000	135320	I just think that the technology, sorry, is a tool for teachers to help the students
135320	141920	or the child to make more research.
141920	154640	It's a tool that they can use, for example, to go far away from their, from what they
154640	155640	know.
155640	161760	The teacher can not know everything, so when, for example, they work on the project
161760	169560	or something, they can use the technology to help them to work, to reach new methods
169560	171680	of working, of teaching.
171680	177600	In fact, this is a good argument, but I think that we should also take account in account
177600	186240	that technology at school could have a negative impact on the student life as far for the
186240	193560	screen time, because technology is present everywhere, so at home also, and if there is
193560	202600	no break between use at home and at school, it can lead to addiction and problems like anxiety.
202600	210160	Yes, I agree, but that is our work, that is a teacher work and parents work.
210160	217440	We need to control the time that the child spent on the screen, for example.
217440	225560	We can work only two hours a day on screen, sorry, screens at school, and the parents
225560	231360	can control the times when the child will come back at home.
231360	238080	So the child will not spend too much time on the screen, and we can do like exercise,
238080	244920	like who seems like feedback, to talk about what did you see on screen, what did you
244920	253280	think to make, to share together with the children, to have their feelings about the screen,
253280	258400	and to check if they are good with it.
258400	265240	So what I hear you say is that the traditional way of teaching is still needed, and therefore
265240	270320	it also shows that technology has maybe not spread in a classroom, if you still need
270320	274240	the balance between traditional teaching and technology.
274240	281080	So I think technology can be useful, but you also have to take account that not everyone
281080	286800	has access to it, and if maybe we start using it, then we have to homework to do with
286800	292400	it, and researches, and some students don't have access to that because of low income.
292400	294240	That keeps them disadvantaged them.
294240	304160	That's why I think that the state's best pay for it, because I think, for example, the
304160	309920	states can buy computers or some adversities for the school.
309920	315040	The school we rented to the students, so they will have all the same computers, all the
315040	322920	same advices, so they will be not, like I say, disparities, I can say it like this,
322920	325000	disparities between them.
325000	337280	It will be easier for the teacher because they will have all the same computers or adversities,
337280	344920	and they will not be disparities because they will work, they will be equal, I see.
345120	351720	But I also hear that it's a very expensive project, like I said, to buy the computers, to
351720	356920	keep the maintenance up, everything.
356920	364280	I don't think every school, every state has the money for that in every school, and more
364280	365280	over.
365280	369520	When maintenance is needed, you can't use the technology, so you can also slow down
369520	372800	the learning process while it's in maintenance.
372800	373800	Could you repeat?
374440	382160	While computers, technology devices are in maintenance, they can't be used, so it slows
382160	384160	down the learning process.
384160	389560	Not, because to my mind, the learning process is not based on technology, it's just a
389560	398200	tool that they can use to help them, it's not the majority of the works, so it will not
398200	406800	be like something missing when they are in maintenance, you understand.
406800	414120	The teacher will work with, like you said, traditional methods, but they can use the technology
414120	421840	to help them to bring new methods, to adapt their methods to students which are maybe
421840	430040	different, maybe who wants to discover something, different, because they have a different
430040	431840	level, for example.
431840	440760	What about exams, because when you learn to take on a computer or to work on a computer
440760	449120	and then you find yourself in front of a sheet and a traditional way of writing exams,
449120	453480	if you students may be lost, because they are not that used to it.
453480	457600	To my mind, it depends of the skills.
457600	463600	For example, if in class they used to work mathematics without a computer, they should
463600	472160	do the exam without the computer, but if they work something like a French with the
472160	476280	computers, they will pass the exam with the computers, too.
476280	480280	Like this, they will have the habits.
480280	489240	I hear you, and I feel like we can go to a compromise where we think that technology can
489240	495520	be used, but with limits and work that in the schools with the teacher who need a lot
495520	496520	of training.
496520	503160	Exactly, like I said, the technology will not be the base of the teaching, it will be just
503160	508040	a plus tools that can be used by the teacher to help the children.
