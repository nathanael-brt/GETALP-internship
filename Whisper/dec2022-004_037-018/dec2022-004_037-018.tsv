8000	17000	Hello, so we need to make some suggestions to the world.
17000	26000	Hello, we need to make some suggestions to our speaker about new technology in teaching.
26000	29000	What do you think about that?
29000	40000	I personally think that incorporating technologies in our class could cause more harm than good.
40000	52000	First, because it's very expensive and maybe our school is not able to afford that kind of technologies.
52000	64000	I think personally, if we make a good plan, so we make a big investment first.
64000	74000	But we make a good plan, so we need to make a big investment later.
74000	89000	And it can reduce the cost because we don't have to work out to technology experts if a troubleshooting appears.
89000	96000	But yes, they are some cost in maintenance, etc.
96000	108000	Yes, but there are some, I agree with you, but there are some costs that need, that are too expensive to be made.
108000	122000	For example, there are some rural areas that aren't equipped with a very good internet connection and building a good internet connection would cost a lot.
122000	138000	Yes, but if we make a good internet connection, for example, we can increase the skill of our students because we can make an evolution of our teaching.
138000	150000	Like a teacher can give a subject to a student and a student with a good internet connection can make research about the subject.
150000	166000	And that's really great for the teaching and for the students and can add some interest to the students because some students cannot be interested by teaching paper and pencil.
166000	178000	Yes, but there are a lot of disparities between people who can't afford a computer and people who cannot afford a computer.
178000	200000	And people who have, we don't have the money for it, are not used to use computers so they will be not at the same level as people who already know how to use a computer so they will have to be trained even more.
200000	226000	Yes, there are some costs to train the teacher or the students, but if we train the teacher, if we make a big advancement of new technology, if the students add interest of our teaching, and yes, there are some disparities,
226000	236000	but we can help the students with a computer we lead to us or etc.
236000	265000	So we can increase our skills and now we are in the 21st century and the computer is the skills we need to be know because we use old-day computers like for typing, for presenting and presentation etc.
265000	294000	I agree, but there's still a risk that students will just use the computers as a teaching method and not really interact with their teachers or interact with other students or being on the computer all day long can lead to a lack of social skills or anxiety.
294000	303000	Or anxiety or being very dependent on the computer and not on classic teaching methods.
303000	318000	Yes, yes, but we can also create book clubs or writing clubs. The students can read a book or try to write etc.
318000	333000	That's good for the assessment, but we need also to remake the assessment with a computer.
333000	351000	For example, we can make an assessment with a computer. If we give some computer to students at their assessments and could be great for us.
364000	373000	So we can make a transition between the paper and pencil and the technology.
373000	383000	We can make some transition step by step with incorporating technology little by little on our teaching.
383000	385000	It could be great.
385000	406000	Yeah, probably only use computers only a few hours a day or during certain lessons or we could also just use computers at school and not at home to prevent students.
406000	430000	So can you only use computer on technology lessons, for example, or for a mathematical lesson, for example, that could be a good transition for incorporating technology in your teaching and also make our school modern with some technologies.
